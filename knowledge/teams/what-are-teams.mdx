In this tutorial, you will learn everything about the core functionality of bundle.social and what you can achieve with it.

## What is a team in bundle.social?

To put it simply, each organization can have many teams. Each team is basically a social set - a group of social accounts releted to a single entity. This can be a company, a project, or even a personal brand.

## How do I create a team?

When you are joining for the first time, you will be asked to create your first free team, which you can later upgrade.
