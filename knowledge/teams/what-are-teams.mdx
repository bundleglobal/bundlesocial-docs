In this tutorial, you will learn everything about the core functionality of bundle.social and what you can achieve with it.

## What is a team in bundle.social?

To put it simply, each organization can have many teams. Each team is basically a social set - a group of social accounts releted to a single entity. This can be a company, a project, or even a personal brand.

## How do I create a team?

When you are joining for the first time, you will be asked to create your first free team, which you can later upgrade.

<Tip>
  You are managing the currently selected team, your changes will affect only
  one team at a time.
</Tip>

In this section, you will learn about team options and management. Let's start by locating the team menu.
It is located right in the middle of the sidebar and looks like this:

Let's start from the top.

## How can I invite or remove someone from the team?

You will see a **Members** management panel. In this panel, you can see how many team members you currently have. You can also remove someone from the team by clicking the three dots at the end of the row, which will display a popup.
