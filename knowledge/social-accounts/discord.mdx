title: Connect your Discord account to bundle.social
---

<Warning>
  Discord and Slack is weird with their API's, to post content you need to use
  BOT's that you will create. <br />
  Don't worry it's their way of doing things not our magic so they wont ban you [**learn
  more**](/knowledge/posts/dc-slack-bots.mdx).
</Warning>

In this short tutorial you will learn how to connect your Discord account to bundle.social

<h2>First things first, create a team or be a part of one</h2>
If you don't know what the teams are, [click here](/knowledge/teams/what-are-teams)
to get up to speed.

## Connect your Discord account

bundle.social is built in a way that won't let you down. If you are in a team and
there is no social account connected, your dashboard will look like this.

<Frame type='glass'>
  <img src='/images/knowledge/social-accounts/youtube/001_youtube.png' />
</Frame>
But if you are a new person joining an existing team, you will most likely see the
**Post** page first. If so, navigate to the left corner of the screen and press the
**Social accounts** button. Click it and _voil√†_, you are in the right place.

</Frame>
Now, click **Connect** on the Discord tile.

</Frame>
You will be asked to log.

</Frame>
Next, you will see what permissions we need for the app to run. Click **Continue**.

</Frame>
Now you will see additional info about permissions, click **Authorize**.

<Note>
  bundle.social staff does not have access to your account or account keys, we
  cannot delete your account.

</Frame>
After a successful connection, you will be redirected back to bundle.social, and
you should see a green popup on the right-hand side, and the Discord tile button
should say **Disconnect**.

## Errors

There should be no errors at this point, but if there are, it will be these two:

<Warning>Error connecting to Discord</Warning>
This can mean many things outside our control, maybe Discord had a bug or there was
a timeout. If you get this error, simply retry. Most often, it will help.
<Warning>
  You don't have enough permissions in any of your Discord servers.
</Warning>
You are probably not an admin for your Slack workspace.
