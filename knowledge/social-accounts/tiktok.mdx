In this short tutorial, you will learn how to connect your TikTok account to bundle.social.

<h2>First things first, create a team or be a part of one</h2>
If you're unfamiliar with what the teams are, [click here](/knowledge/teams/what-are-teams)
to get up to speed.

## Connect your TikTok account

bundle.social is built in a way that won't let you down. If you are in a team and there is no social account connected, your dashboard will look like this:

<Frame type='glass'>
  <img src='/images/knowledge/social-accounts/youtube/001_youtube.png' />
</Frame>

But if you are a new person joining an existing team, you will most likely see the **Post**
page first. If so, navigate to the left corner of the screen and press the **Social accounts**
button. Click it and _voilà_, you are in the right place.

</Frame>

Now, click **Connect** on the TikTok tile.

<Frame type='glass'>
  <img src='/images/knowledge/social-accounts/tiktok/001_tiktok.png' />
</Frame>

You will be asked to log in; choose your preferred method and proceed. We picked Google.

</Frame>

Next, you will be prompted to pick which Google account you want to log in with.

<Frame type='glass'>
  <img src='/images/knowledge/social-accounts/tiktok/003_tiktok.png' />
</Frame>

Log in.

<Frame type='glass'>
  <img src='/images/knowledge/social-accounts/tiktok/004_tiktok.png' />
</Frame>

Great, now allow all access for the app by selecting all the checkboxes and clicking **Continue**.

<Note>
  bundle.social staff does not have access to your account or account keys; we
  cannot delete your account.

</Frame>

After a successful connection, you will be redirected back to bundle.social, and you should see a green popup on the right-hand side, and the TikTok tile button should say **Disconnect**.

## Errors

There should be no errors at this point, but if there are, they will likely be these two:

<Warning>Error connecting to TikTok</Warning>
This can mean many things outside our control maybe there was a bug with Tiktok or
a timeout. If you encounter this error, simply retry. Most often, it will resolve
the issue.

<Warning>
  You didn't grant all the necessary permissions
</Warning>
This means that you didn't grant all the permissions we need to post on your behalf. You can try to reconnect and grant all the permissions.

<Warning>You don't have enough permissions.</Warning>
Remember when we earlier told you to grant the app all access? You probably didn't. <br />
Click **Disconnect** and connect your account again, this time with all
permissions.
