<h2>First things first, create a team or be a part of one</h2>

to get up to speed.

## Connect your Linkedin account

bundle.social is built in a way that won't let you down. If you are in a team and
there is no social account connected, your dashboard will look like this.

<Frame type='glass'>
  <img src='/images/knowledge/social-accounts/youtube/001_youtube.png' />
</Frame>
But if you are a new person joining an existing team, you will most likely see the
**Post** page first. If so, navigate to the left corner of the screen and press the
**Social accounts** button. Click it and _voil√†_, you are in the right place.

Now, click **Connect** on the Linkedin tile.

</Frame>
You will be asked to log in.

  bundle.social staff does not have access to your account or account keys, we
  cannot delete your account.

After successful login you will be prompted to pick what page or account you
want to manage.

After a successful connection, you should see a green popup on the right-hand
side and the Linkedin button should say **Disconnect**.

## Errors

There should be no errors at this point, but if there are, it will be these two:

<Warning>Error connecting to Linkedin</Warning>
This can mean many things outside our control, maybe you don't have a Linkedin account
connected to this Google account or Linkedin had a bug or there was a timeout. If
you get this error, simply retry. Most often, it will help.

<Warning>
  You didn't grant all the necessary permissions
</Warning>
This means that you didn't grant all the permissions we need to post on your behalf. You can try to reconnect and grant all the permissions.

<Warning>
  You don't have enough permissions in any of your LinkedIn organizations.
</Warning>
You are probably not an admin for picked account.
