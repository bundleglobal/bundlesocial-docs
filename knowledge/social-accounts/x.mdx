In this short tutorial you will learn how to connect your X (Twitter) account to bundle.social

<h2>First things first, create a team or be a part of one</h2>
If you don't know what the teams are, [click here](/knowledge/teams/what-are-teams)
to get up to speed.

## Connect your X (Twitter) account

bundle.social is built in a way that won't let you down. If you are in a team and
there is no social account connected, your dashboard will look like this.

<Frame type='glass'>
  <img src='/images/knowledge/social-accounts/youtube/001_youtube.png' />
</Frame>
But if you are a new person joining an existing team, you will most likely see the
**Post** page first. If so, navigate to the left corner of the screen and press the
**Social accounts** button. Click it and _voil√†_, you are in the right place.

</Frame>
Now, click **Connect** on the X (Twitter) tile.
<Frame type='glass'>

</Frame>
You will be asked to log in.
<Frame type='glass'>

</Frame>

Great, now allow all access for the app and click. **Authorize app**.

<Note>
  bundle.social staff does not have access to your account or account keys, we
  cannot delete your account.
</Note>

</Frame>
After a successful connection, you will be redirected back to bundle.social, and
you should see a green popup on the right-hand side, and the X (Twitter) tile
button should say **Disconnect**.

## Errors

There should be no errors at this point, but if you encounter one, it might be this:

<Warning>Error connecting to Twitter</Warning>
This can mean many things outside our control, maybe X (Twitter) had a bug or there
was a timeout. If you get this error, simply retry. Most often, it will help.

<Warning>
  You didn't grant all the necessary permissions
</Warning>
This means that you didn't grant all the permissions we need to post on your behalf. You can try to reconnect and grant all the permissions.
