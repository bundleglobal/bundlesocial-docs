## It's complicated? No, not really

If you go on for a deep dive in Discord and Slack documentation you can learn that they don't support API access to user account. <br/>
If you want to automate something they provide bots and API control for them. Thats what we are using, so there is no tomfoolery on our side.

## How to create bots on bundle.social
