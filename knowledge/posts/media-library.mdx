## Media Library is a "storage"

Yes and no. Let us explain how it works. Media in bundle.social is either:

- **used** - you made a post with it,
- **unused** - you did not make a post with it.

You have a hard limit of **100 pieces of content that are unused**, so you can upload the content, and when the time comes, you can make a post with it. There is no limit for used media.

## How to use the Media Library

On the sidebar, click **Media Library**.

<Frame type='glass'>
  <img src='/images/knowledge/media-library/001_media_library.png' />
</Frame>

Now you can see your **Media Library** dashboard. To upload something, either click on the **gray** area or just drop it there.

    </Frame>
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How to see content details?

Sometimes, if you have multiple versions of a photo/video, you aren't sure if the one you uploaded is the correct one. To check the metadata of the content, hover over the content and click the **eye** icon.

  <Frame type='glass'>
    <img src='/images/knowledge/media-library/004_media_library.png' />
  </Frame>
</Card>

Now you can see the metadata.

  </Frame>
</Card>

## How to delete content from the Media Library?

You can hover over content and press the **trash bin** icon or select multiple pieces of content and click **Delete selected**.

<Frame type='glass'>
  <img src='/images/knowledge/media-library/006_media_library.png' />
</Frame>
<Note>
  By deleting content that is unused, you are updating your **unused uploads**
  limit.
</Note>

## Filtering in the Media Library

Here you can see two filters: one is for status, and the second one is for type, which is either:

- image,
- video.

That's self-explanatory, so let us focus on the status filter.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card>
    <Frame type='glass'>
      <img src='/images/knowledge/media-library/007_media_library.png' />
    </Frame>
  </Card>
  <Card>
    <Frame type='glass'>
      <img src='/images/knowledge/media-library/008_media_library.png' />
    </Frame>
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

When set to **All**, you can see **ALL** of your content.

<Frame type='glass'>
  <img src='/images/knowledge/media-library/009_media_library.png' />
</Frame>

When set to **Used**, you can see **ONLY USED** content. This is the content that you have already used on some platform, like Instagram.

<Frame type='glass'>
  <img src='/images/knowledge/media-library/010_media_library.png' />
</Frame>

When set to **Unused**, you can see **ONLY UNUSED** content. This is the content that is not posted anywhere.

<Frame type='glass'>
  <img src='/images/knowledge/media-library/011_media_library.png' />
</Frame>

## Summary

The Media Library is a neat feature that lets you post on the go and see what content you have already used.
