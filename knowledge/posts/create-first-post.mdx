## Quick note

<Warning>
🥺 YOU CAN POST DIFFERENT CONTENT TO ALL THE PLATFORMS ALL AT ONCE 🥴
</Warning>

## Your first post

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use bundle.social, get your accounts and media ready. <br /> <br />
On the sidebar, click **Posts**.

<Frame type='glass'>
  <img src='/images/knowledge/posts/001_first_post.png' />
</Frame>

Now you can see your **Posts** dashboard, there is nothing here for now. <br />
Click the **+** icon to open **post creator**.

<Frame type='glass'>
  <img src='/images/knowledge/posts/002_first_post.png' />
</Frame>

The first page of the post creator is strictly internal. Here, you can pick what account you're going to post on, what content you're going to post, and at what time.

<Frame type='glass'>
  <img src='/images/knowledge/posts/003_first_post.png' />
</Frame>
<Note>
  You can change these things later, so if your creative juices are not flowing
  from the get-go, don't worry.
</Note>

## Picking the platform

At the top of the screen, you can see all your connected accounts **for the team that you are currently on**. Pick which account you want to post on by clicking on the appropriate tile.

<Frame type='glass'>
  <img src='/images/knowledge/posts/004_first_post.png' />
</Frame>

We will be posting on all 4 connected platforms:

- YouTube and Instagram for video,
- LinkedIn for some company updates,
- Discord to engage with the community. <br/>
  (Sounds so real, we know.)

## Pick the content for the post

We understand that you might be on the go or just be clumsy and not have the right content with you at all times. That's why we have the **media library** (you can learn more about it here). For now, all you need to know is that **this is internal storage**. <br /> <br />
Click **select media**.

<Frame type='glass'>
  <img src='/images/knowledge/posts/005_first_post.png' />
</Frame>

Here you can see all of your media. You can pick from it or **upload a new one**. We will add one photo, and the rest will be from the [**media library**](/link/to/media).

<Frame type='glass'>
  <img src='/images/knowledge/posts/006_first_post.png' />
</Frame>

## Set the time

Let's say that your boss told you that you need to post every 3 hours. Instead of sitting down every 3 hours, you can just pick a time and forget about it.

<Frame type='glass'>
  <img src='/images/knowledge/posts/007_first_post.png' />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  If you don't set a time or the time is earlier than the current time, the post
  will be added as soon as processing is finished.
</Tip>

## Customize your content

In the bottom right corner, click **Customize**.

<Frame type='glass'>
  <img src='/images/knowledge/posts/008_first_post.png' />
</Frame>

Your screen should look like this:

<Frame type='glass'>
  <img src='/images/knowledge/posts/009_first_post.png' />
</Frame>

Great, let's start from the top:

- **Title**: Internal only
- **Date**: When to post it

Now, you can see platform icons, those are tabs. Click around, and you can see that some things are changing, like on YouTube you have a **Text** field and a **Description** field, but on Instagram there is only **Text**.

<Frame type='glass'>
  <img src='/images/knowledge/posts/010_first_post.png' />
</Frame>

### Adjust the content

In the tabs previously mentioned, you have your content field. When you hover over content, you can delete it, for example, on the YouTube tab, we are leaving only the video that we want to post.

<Frame type='glass'>
  <img src='/images/knowledge/posts/011_first_post.png' />
</Frame>

## Multiple pieces of content

<Warning>
  If you want to post multiple images, for example, on Instagram, just leave the
  content untouched. We support multi-content on all platforms that already have
  it.
</Warning>
Great, now we can click on the Instagram tab and remove all the unwanted content
for that platform.

<Info>You can also add content at this step.</Info>
<Frame type='glass'>
  <img src='/images/knowledge/posts/012_first_post.png' />
</Frame>
Let's do that for the rest of the platforms.

## Discord and Slack quirk

To learn in depth about the bots [**click here**](/knowledge/posts/dc-slack-bots) but for now,
if you post to Discord and Slack without changing the sender of your messege will appear like that

<Card>
  <Frame type='glass'>
    <img src='/images/knowledge/posts/021_first_post.png' />
  </Frame>
</Card>

Thats okay if you don't care but if you care click **+** icon to create new bot.

<Card>
  <Frame type='glass'>
    <img src='/images/knowledge/posts/022_first_post.png' />
  </Frame>
</Card>
You will be displayed a popup, upload bot cover photo and give him a name. The name
will be displayed in Discord/Slack as sender so watch out. <br />
Now click **Create**

<Card>
  <Frame type='glass'>
    <img src='/images/knowledge/posts/023_first_post.png' />
  </Frame>
</Card>
Great, you created the BOT and you will be able to use it next time but **don't forget
to pick newly created BOT from the select input**.

<Card>
  <Frame type='glass'>
    <img src='/images/knowledge/posts/024_first_post.png' />
  </Frame>
</Card>
Now your Discord sender will look like this.
<Card>
  <Frame type='glass'>
    <img src='/images/knowledge/posts/025_first_post.png' />
  </Frame>
</Card>
## Post it

After we added all the captions and images, it's time to post it. <br />
Click **Publish**.

<Frame type='glass'>
  <img src='/images/knowledge/posts/015_first_post.png' />
</Frame>

The page will refresh, and you will see the **Post Dashboard** again, but this time you will see your post. <br />
If there is a lot of content like multiple big videos, the post will have a status of **processing** or **scheduled**, but do not worry, other images will be posted.

<Frame type='glass'>
  <img src='/images/knowledge/posts/016_first_post.png' />
</Frame>

## Access the content

Click the post instance. Here you will see a list of links to each post.

<Frame type='glass'>
  <img src='/images/knowledge/posts/017_first_post.png' />
</Frame>
Here you can see our LinkedIn post.
<Frame type='glass'>
  <img src='/images/knowledge/posts/018_first_post.png' />
</Frame>
## Deleting a post

For security reasons, you cannot delete a post via our app, you can only remove the post instance from bundle.social.

    <Frame type='glass'>
      <img src='/images/knowledge/posts/020_first_post.png' />
    </Frame>
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
If you want to remove the posts via bundle.social, shoot us an email. If there are
enough requests, we will enable that option ~ 50/50.
