</Note>

### TL;DR

Publer is a solid mid-range scheduling tool with a generous feature set for the price. Their base plans start at \$12/month with 3 accounts. But they scale per-account, have no API, and charge extra for Twitter/X. If you need developer tools or unlimited accounts, we've got you.

## Where Publer Wins

- **Low entry price.** \$12/month for 3 accounts with unlimited scheduling is genuinely affordable. Hard to argue with that for solo users.
- **RSS auto-posting.** Automatically publish from RSS feeds. Nice for content curation workflows.
- **AI Assist.** Unlimited AI prompts on Business plan (\$21/mo). Helpful for generating captions and ideas.
- **Post recycling.** Automatically re-share evergreen content on a schedule. We don't have this.
- **Browser extension.** Quick-share from anywhere while browsing. Handy.
- **Free plan.** 3 accounts (no Twitter/X), 10 scheduled posts per account. Good for testing.

## Where bundle.social Wins

- **API access.** Publer has no API. If you're building a SaaS product or integration, they can't help you.
- **Unlimited accounts.** Publer charges for additional accounts beyond the base 3. With 7 accounts, you're paying \$28-37/mo. With 15 accounts, it climbs fast. We include unlimited on all tiers.
- **Unlimited users.** Publer charges extra for team members beyond the base plan. We don't.
- **Developer tools.** SDK, webhooks, OpenAPI spec. Publer is dashboard-only.
- **More platforms.** We support 14 including Discord, Slack, and Bluesky.
- **Twitter/X included.** Publer restricts Twitter/X to paid plans because of API costs. We include it on all tiers.
- **No content limits.** Publer's free plan caps at 10 scheduled posts per account with 25 saved drafts.

## The Pricing Reality

| Scenario | bundle.social | Publer |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 3 accounts, 1 user | \$100/mo (Pro) | \$12/mo (Professional) |
| 7 accounts, 1 user | \$100/mo (Pro) | \$28/mo (Professional) |
| 15 accounts, 3 users | \$100/mo (Pro) | ~\$60-70/mo (Business + extras) |
| 30 accounts, agency | \$400/mo (Business) | Custom/Enterprise |
| API access | \$100/mo (Pro) | Not available |

Publer is cheaper for small setups (under 10 accounts). Once you're managing many accounts or need programmatic access, we're the better value.
