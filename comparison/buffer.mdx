### TL;DR

Buffer is one of the most well-known scheduling tools out there. Clean UI, simple product. But their per-channel pricing model means costs scale fast when you connect multiple platforms. bundle.social gives you unlimited accounts on a flat fee - plus API access that Buffer doesn't offer.

## Where Buffer Wins

- **Free tier.** 3 channels, 10 posts each. Genuinely useful for personal brands testing the waters.
- **Simple, clean UI.** Buffer's interface is famously simple. If you just want to type and schedule, it's hard to beat.
- **Start Page.** Their link-in-bio tool is clean and well-integrated.
- **AI Assistant.** Built-in AI for repurposing content, generating ideas, and adjusting tone. Included on paid plans.
- **Lower starting price.** If you only need 3-5 channels, Buffer's Essentials plan (\$18-30/mo) is cheaper than our Pro tier.

## Where bundle.social Wins

- **Flat pricing.** Here's the thing about Buffer's per-channel model: connecting 10 platforms costs \$60/mo on Essentials or \$120/mo on Team. Our Pro tier is \$100/mo for unlimited accounts. The more you connect, the better our deal gets.
- **API access.** Buffer has no public API for scheduling or publishing. If you're building a product, they can't help you. We're API-first.
- **Unlimited users.** Buffer's Team plan charges \$12/channel/mo (vs \$6 on Essentials). That 2x jump just for adding a teammate adds up.
- **More platforms.** We support 14 including Discord, Slack, Bluesky, and Google Business. Buffer covers 8.
- **Developer tools.** SDK, webhooks, OpenAPI spec. Buffer is a dashboard - you can't build on top of it.
- **100,000 posts.** On our Business tier. Buffer's unlimited posting is per-channel, but our volume on Business is designed for serious SaaS platforms.

## The Pricing Reality

Buffer's per-channel model means your bill grows with every connected account:

| Scenario | bundle.social | Buffer |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 3 channels, 1 user | \$100/mo (Pro) | \$18/mo (Essentials) |
| 10 channels, 1 user | \$100/mo (Pro) | \$60/mo (Essentials) |
| 10 channels, 3 users | \$100/mo (Pro) | \$120/mo (Team) |
| 25 channels, agency | \$400/mo (Business) | \$175/mo (Essentials, tiered) |
| API access | \$100/mo (Pro) | Not available |

Buffer wins on low channel counts. But if you're connecting 10+ accounts across multiple platforms (which is typical for agencies and SaaS products), our flat pricing makes more sense.

## Who Should Pick What

**Pick Buffer if:**
- You're a solo creator or small brand with 3-5 channels
- You want the simplest possible scheduling UI
- You don't need API access or developer tools
- Budget is under \$30/month and you don't need team features
- Their AI assistant is valuable for your content workflow

**Pick bundle.social if:**
- You're connecting 10+ social accounts (the math tips in our favor)
- You need API access for building integrations or automations
- You want unlimited users without per-channel cost multipliers
- You're a developer, SaaS builder, or agency
- You need Discord, Slack, Bluesky, or Google Business support
