## bundle.social vs Buffer

<Warning>
  Listen, the comparison is on our website, so it may feel biased, but we will
  try to stick to the facts.
</Warning>

When we looked at Buffer's prices, we were a bit surprised. They had really cheap options that would have priced us out, but then we started reading further.

You see this **/for 1 channel** note. We initially thought that their "channel" was equivalent to our "team," but it turns out that:

- 1 channel equals 1 social media platform.

So, just to post to the same 10 social media platforms, it's 60 dollars (based on the lowest tier subscription) vs. our 20. <br />
Granted, they have options that we don't offer:

- URL shortening.
- Native app.
- Integration with Mastodon.

However, they also boast about their analytics, which are just repackaged responses from the Facebook API (allegedly).

## Why is bundle.social cheaper?

We sleep in bunk-bed.

## Why they are better

They are a larger platform with more resources.

## Why they are worse

To get the same functionality as us, multiple users etc. you need to pay them:

- 12 dolars per platform, totaling 120 a month.

## Summary

Overall, we seen worse. They are like a premium coffee and a cigarette before a wedding. Great taste, but not the right timing.
