## bundle.social vs Ayrshare

<Warning>
  Listen, the comparison is on our website, so it will feel biased, but we will
  try to stick to the facts.
</Warning>

Comparing with Ayrshare isn't the easiest as their pricing does not make sense to us.
We use the number of posts as a metric, because it is the most fair way to compare. They use the number of social profiles connected, which depending on what is your product may not be the best metric and creates a headache for you to manage and disconnect accounts that are not used to not overpay.
