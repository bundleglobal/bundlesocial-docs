## bundle.social vs Ayrshare

<Warning>
  Listen, the comparison is on our website, so it will feel biased, but we will
  try to stick to the facts.
</Warning>

Comparing with Ayrshare isn't the easiest as their pricing does not make sense to us.
Don't get me wrong, the app is probably great, but for 80 dollars, you have the same stuff that we have for 26 dollars.
We offer unlimited posting (no, not really best you can get is 50 a day), but this comes up to 1,550 posts in a month.

## Why is bundle.social cheaper?

We don't live in NY.

## Differences and Similarities

We didn't know how to compare our tiers as their prices are **wildly different**, so we will compare our most expensive one with their starter subscription.

## 26 vs. 80

- We both have an API.
- 1,550 posts per month vs. 1,000 posts per month.
- They have "Google Business Profile," whatever this is.
- We both have analytics.
- We both support multiple images and videos per post.
- We both have scheduling.
- They have RSS feed posting.
- They have "Priority Email & Chat Support," but we are unemployed, so it's the same.
- We have link in bio.
- We have API access.

## Cherry on top

To get same behaviour as us, multiple users etc... you need to pay them:
