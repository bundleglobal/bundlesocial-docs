## bundle.social vs Ayrshare

<Note>
This comparison is on our website, so take it with a grain of salt. We'll stick to facts and publicly available pricing. If something's wrong, [tell us](https://bundle.social/contact).
</Note>

### TL;DR

This is the comparison that actually matters. Ayrshare is the closest competitor we have - both API-first, both built for developers. The key differences: we use flat pricing (posts as the metric), they use per-profile pricing. We include unlimited profiles, they charge per connected account. Same arena, very different pricing models.

## Where Ayrshare Wins

Credit where it's due:

- **Multi-language SDKs.** They have Python, Ruby, PHP, and more. We currently have Node.js.
- **RSS posting.** Auto-post from RSS feeds. We don't have this yet.
- **Facebook Ads integration.** Boost posts directly via API (\$100/mo add-on). We don't offer ad management.

## Where bundle.social Wins

- **Unlimited profiles. Full stop.** This is the big one. Ayrshare's Business plan includes 30 profiles for \$599/mo, with each additional profile costing \$8.99/mo. If you're building a SaaS with 100+ connected accounts, that's \$599 + \$630 = \$1,229/mo on Ayrshare vs \$400/mo on bundle.social.
- **100x the posts for the same price.** Our Business tier gives you 100,000 posts/mo for \$400. Ayrshare's Business gives you 1,000 posts/mo for \$599. Read that again.
- **No per-user charges.** Ayrshare charges \$6.99/mo per extra user. We include unlimited users on all tiers.
- **Lower entry for multi-brand.** Our Pro tier starts at \$100/mo with unlimited profiles. Ayrshare's Launch (10 profiles) is \$299/mo.
- **Webhooks on all tiers.** Ayrshare restricts webhooks to Business and up. We include them everywhere.
- **More platforms.** We support Discord and Slack. Useful for community-driven products.

## The Pricing Reality

This is where it gets interesting. Let's compare apples to apples:

| Scenario | bundle.social | Ayrshare |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 brand, API access | \$100/mo (Pro) | \$149/mo (Premium) |
| 10 profiles, API + webhooks | \$100/mo (Pro) | \$299/mo (Launch) |
| 30 profiles, full features | \$400/mo (Business) | \$599/mo (Business) |
| 100 profiles | \$400/mo (Business) | \$599 + \$630 = ~\$1,229/mo |
| 500 profiles | \$400/mo (Business) | \$599 + \$2,543 = ~\$3,142/mo |
| Posts included | 100,000 (Business) | 1,000 (Business) |

The more profiles you connect, the wider the gap gets. If you're building a SaaS platform where each customer connects their own social accounts, our flat model scales dramatically better.

## The Profile Pricing Trap

Here's the thing about per-profile pricing: it creates anxiety.

If your SaaS lets users connect social accounts, every new customer activation costs you \$8.99/mo on Ayrshare. You start optimizing for fewer connections instead of more. You add code to disconnect idle accounts. You build billing alerts instead of features.

With bundle.social, a new user connecting 5 accounts costs you \$0 extra. You focus on growth, not cost management.

## Who Should Pick What

**Pick Ayrshare if:**
- You need Python, Ruby, or PHP SDKs (we only have Node.js for now)
- RSS auto-posting is critical for your workflow
- You need Facebook Ads management via API

**Pick bundle.social if:**
- You're building a SaaS where users connect their own social accounts (unlimited profiles)
- Volume matters - you need more than 1,000 posts/month
- You want webhooks without paying for the Business tier
- You want unlimited users without per-seat charges
- You need Discord or Slack integration
- Your connected profile count is unpredictable or growing
