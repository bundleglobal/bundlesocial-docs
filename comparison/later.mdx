### TL;DR

Later started as an Instagram-first scheduling tool and grew from there. They have a strong visual planner, AI credits, and a clean UI. But their pricing scales with users, social sets, and post limits - and they don't offer an API. If you're building something programmatic, we're the better fit.

## Where Later Wins

- **Visual planner.** Later's drag-and-drop visual calendar is genuinely great, especially for Instagram-heavy brands that care about grid aesthetics.
- **Lower starting price.** \$25/month for their Starter plan is accessible for small creators. Though you get 1 social set and 30 posts/profile/month.
- **AI credits.** Built-in AI for caption writing and content ideas. 5-100 credits depending on tier.
- **Linkin.bio.** Their link-in-bio tool is well-polished and Instagram-native.
- **Snapchat support.** If you need Snapchat, Later has it. We don't.
- **Instagram-first DNA.** If Instagram is your primary platform, Later's tooling around visual planning, grid preview, and optimal timing is mature.

## Where bundle.social Wins

- **API access.** Later has no API. If you're building a SaaS product, internal tool, or any automation - they're a dead end.
- **Unlimited accounts and users.** Later caps social sets (1-6 depending on plan) and charges extra for additional sets (\$11.25-15/mo each) and users (\$5/mo each). We include unlimited everything.
- **More platforms.** We support 14 including Discord, Slack, Mastodon, Bluesky, and Google Business. Later covers 8.
- **No post limits on Pro.** Later's Starter caps at 30 posts per profile per month. Our Pro gives you 1,000 across the org.
- **Developer tools.** SDK, webhooks, OpenAPI spec. Later is a pure dashboard product.
- **Flat pricing.** No surprises when you add users, sets, or channels.

## The Pricing Reality

Later's pricing adds up as you scale:

| Scenario | bundle.social | Later |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 user, 1 brand, basic | \$100/mo (Pro) | \$25/mo (Starter) |
| 3 users, 2 brands | \$100/mo (Pro) | \$50/mo (Growth) + extras |
| 4 users, 6 brands | \$400/mo (Business) | \$110/mo (Scale) + extra sets |
| API access | \$100/mo (Pro) | Not available |

Later wins for solo creators and small teams with 1-2 brands. But the moment you scale beyond that - more brands, more users, or especially API access - bundle.social is the better deal.

## Who Should Pick What

**Pick Later if:**
- You're an Instagram-first creator who loves visual grid planning
- You have 1-2 brands and 1-3 team members
