## bundle.social vs Later

<Warning>
  Listen, the comparison is on our website, so it may feel biased, but we will
  try to stick to the facts.
</Warning>

Later is a decent platform, but in terms of pricing, they don't stack up well against us. They support fewer platforms, but they have "sets," which are equivalent to our "teams." Unfortunately for them, we offer an unlimited number of users, while in Later, the pricing structure looks like this:

If you look closely, to have a similar number of posts to us, you need to spend at least $80 and are still limited in the "user" aspect.
