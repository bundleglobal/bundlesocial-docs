## Where Sprout Social Wins

Let's be real. Sprout Social is a beast of a platform:

- **Social listening and monitoring.** They can track brand mentions, keywords, and sentiment across the internet. We don't do this.
- **Smart inbox.** Unified inbox for DMs, comments, and mentions across platforms. Great for customer support teams.
- **Enterprise reporting.** Custom dashboards, competitor benchmarking, paid social tracking. Their reporting is seriously powerful.
- **CRM integrations.** Native Salesforce, HubSpot, and Zendesk connections. If your workflow lives in a CRM, this matters.
- **Team workflows.** Approval chains, task assignments, team productivity reports. Built for 20+ person social teams.

If you're a large brand with a dedicated social media team that needs listening, CRM, and enterprise reporting - Sprout is built for you.

## Where bundle.social Wins

- **Price.** A 3-person team on Sprout Professional costs \$897/month. Our Business tier with unlimited users is \$400/month. That's not a typo.
- **API-first.** Our entire platform is built around the API. If you're a SaaS company building social media features into your product, we're purpose-built for this. Sprout's API is an afterthought locked behind the \$399/seat tier.
- **No per-seat pricing.** Add 5 users or 50 users - same price. Sprout charges \$199-399 per additional seat.
- **Unlimited social accounts.** On all tiers. Sprout's Standard plan caps at 5 profiles.
- **Developer experience.** SDK, webhooks, OpenAPI spec, detailed platform-specific docs. We're built for developers, not marketing managers.
- **14 platforms.** Including Discord, Slack, Mastodon, and Bluesky. Sprout focuses on the major platforms.

## The Pricing Reality

Let's do the math for a typical SaaS company with 3 team members:

| Scenario | bundle.social | Sprout Social |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 3 users, basic | \$100/mo (Pro) | \$597/mo (Standard) |
| 3 users, with API | \$100/mo (Pro) | \$1,197/mo (Advanced) |
| 10 users, full features | \$400/mo (Business) | \$2,990/mo (Professional) |

Annual commitment required for Sprout. We do monthly.
