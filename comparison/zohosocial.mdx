### TL;DR

Zoho Social is part of the massive Zoho ecosystem. If you're already neck-deep in Zoho CRM, Zoho Desk, and Zoho Everything-Else, their social tool plugs in neatly. If you're not in the Zoho world and you need an API - that's where we come in.

## Where Zoho Social Wins

- **Zoho ecosystem integration.** If you use Zoho CRM, the native integration is genuinely useful. Lead generation from social, contact enrichment - it's seamless within their world.
- **Lower entry price.** \$15/month for Standard is hard to beat for a solo social media manager who just needs a publishing calendar.
- **Social inbox.** Unified messaging starting at the Professional tier (\$40/mo).
- **Publishing calendar.** Clean, visual, drag-and-drop. Great for non-technical users.
- **SmartQ.** Their AI suggests optimal posting times. Nice touch.

## Where bundle.social Wins

- **API access.** Zoho Social has no public API for social media operations. If you're building a SaaS product, an internal tool, or any kind of integration - they can't help you.
- **Unlimited users.** Zoho charges \$10-13/month per additional team member. Their Premium plan includes only 3 members. Adding 10 users gets expensive.
- **Unlimited accounts.** Our Pro tier gives you unlimited social accounts. Zoho Standard caps at 10 channels.
- **More platforms.** We support 14 including Discord, Slack, Bluesky, and Google Business. Zoho covers 9.
- **Multi-brand without agency pricing.** You need teams for multiple brands? We include that in our standard tiers. Zoho's agency plans start at \$320/month for 10 brands with only 5 team members.
- **Developer tools.** SDK, webhooks, OpenAPI spec. Zoho Social is a dashboard - there's nothing to integrate with programmatically.

## The Pricing Reality

Zoho looks cheap until you need features and users:

| Scenario | bundle.social | Zoho Social |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 user, basic scheduling | \$100/mo (Pro) | \$15/mo (Standard) |
| 1 user, with analytics | \$100/mo (Pro) | \$40/mo (Professional) |
| 5 users, analytics | \$100/mo (Pro) | \$40 + \$40 extra members = ~\$80/mo |
| 10 brands, 5 users | \$400/mo (Business) | \$320/mo (Agency) |
| API access | \$100/mo (Pro) | Not available at any price |

For a single user doing basic scheduling, Zoho is genuinely cheaper. But the moment you add users, brands, or need an API - the math shifts.

## Who Should Pick What
