- **Mature dashboard.** Content calendar, approval workflows, team collaboration - all polished from years of iteration.
- **Social inbox.** Unified messaging across platforms. Great for support teams.
- **Employee advocacy.** Their Amplify tool lets you push content to employees to share. Neat for large orgs.

- **Ad management.** Boost posts and manage paid social directly from the dashboard.
- **Brand recognition.** Everyone knows Hootsuite. Enterprise procurement teams love things they recognize.

## Where bundle.social Wins

- **No per-seat costs.** Hootsuite charges per user. We don't. Whether you have 1 user or 100, same price.
- **Built for developers.** SDK, webhooks, OpenAPI spec, per-platform documentation. Hootsuite is built for marketing managers clicking buttons. We're built for engineers writing code.
- **14 platforms.** Including Discord, Slack, Mastodon, and Bluesky. Hootsuite covers the major ones.
- **Unlimited social accounts.** No caps on any tier.
- **Simpler pricing.** Two tiers. Flat monthly. No add-on upsells for listening, advocacy, or AI chatbots.

## The Pricing Reality

Hootsuite's exact pricing is harder to pin down (they love the "contact us" game on higher tiers), but here's what we know:

| Scenario | bundle.social | Hootsuite |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Solo user, 10 accounts | \$100/mo (Pro) | ~\$99/mo (Professional) |
| 3 users, full features | \$100/mo (Pro) | ~\$249+/mo (Team) |
| 10 users, with API | \$400/mo (Business) | Custom Enterprise pricing |
| Add-ons needed | None | Listening, advocacy, AI chatbot = extra |

With Hootsuite, the sticker price is just the beginning. Add-ons add up fast.
