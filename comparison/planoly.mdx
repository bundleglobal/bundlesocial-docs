## Where Planoly Wins

- **Visual grid planner.** Planoly's Instagram grid preview is their killer feature. Drag, drop, and see how your feed will look before posting. If Instagram aesthetics matter to you, this is best-in-class.
- **Cheapest entry point.** Free plan with 2 profiles and 30 uploads. Paid plans start at \$7-11/month. Hard to beat for personal brands.
- **Instagram DM management.** Manage DMs directly from the platform. Useful for creators handling customer inquiries.
- **Creator-friendly design.** The entire UX is designed for visual creators, not developers. Clean, intuitive, pretty.
- **Storefront features.** Sellit and link-in-bio commerce tools for selling products through social.

## Where bundle.social Wins

- **API access.** Planoly has no API. If you need programmatic access, it's a non-starter.
- **14 platforms vs 6.** We support Discord, Slack, Mastodon, Bluesky, Google Business, LinkedIn, Reddit, and Threads. Planoly focuses on Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Pinterest, YouTube, and Twitter/X.
- **Unlimited everything.** Accounts, users, uploads. Planoly caps social sets (1-2), users (1-3), and uploads (30-unlimited) depending on plan.
- **Volume.** Our Business tier supports 100,000 posts/month. Planoly is designed for individual creators posting a few times a day.
- **Developer tools.** SDK, webhooks, OpenAPI spec.
- **Multi-brand at scale.** Managing 10+ brands on Planoly means paying for extra social sets. We include unlimited teams.

## The Pricing Reality

| Scenario | bundle.social | Planoly |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 user, 1 brand, light use | \$100/mo (Pro) | \$11.25/mo (Starter) |
| 3 users, 1 brand | \$100/mo (Pro) | \$20/mo (Growth) |
| 3 users, 2 brands | \$100/mo (Pro) | \$36.50/mo (Professional) |
| Unlimited brands, agency | \$400/mo (Business) | Not designed for this |
| API access | \$100/mo (Pro) | Not available |

This is less of a "vs" and more of a "different tools for different people." Planoly is for Instagram creators. bundle.social is for developers and SaaS companies.
