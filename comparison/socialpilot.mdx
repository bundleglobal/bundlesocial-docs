### TL;DR

SocialPilot is a popular agency-focused scheduling tool with solid features at mid-range pricing. They offer white-label reports, client workflows, and up to 50 accounts. But they have no API, charge per user, and cap accounts per plan. If you need developer tools or unlimited accounts, that's our turf.

## The Pricing Reality

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 user, 7 accounts | \$100/mo (Pro) | \$30/mo (Essentials) |
| 3 users, 15 accounts | \$100/mo (Pro) | \$50/mo (Standard) |
| 6 users, 25 accounts | \$100/mo (Pro) | \$100/mo (Premium) |
