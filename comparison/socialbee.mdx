### TL;DR

SocialBee is a content-focused scheduling tool with strong category-based posting, Canva integration, and content recycling. Solid product for marketers. But they charge per profile, per user, cap workspaces, and have no API. If you're building something or need unlimited scaling, we're the move.

## Where SocialBee Wins

- **Content categories.** Organize posts into categories (promotions, tips, quotes) and set a schedule per category. Smart approach for content variety.
- **Content recycling.** Automatically re-share evergreen content. Great for solopreneurs who want to maximize a content library.
- **Canva integration.** Design directly within SocialBee. Genuinely convenient.
- **AI Copilot.** Generate content ideas, captions, and hashtags. More sophisticated than simple AI credits.
- **Lower entry price.** \$29/month for 5 profiles is accessible for solo marketers.
- **Workspaces.** Up to 5 workspaces on the Pro plan (\$99/mo) for separating clients or projects.

## Where bundle.social Wins

- **API access.** SocialBee has no API. Can't build on top of it. Can't automate. Can't integrate into your SaaS.
- **Unlimited profiles.** SocialBee caps at 5-25 profiles (standard plans). Want 50? That's \$179/mo (Pro50 agency plan). Want 100? \$329/mo. We include unlimited on all tiers.
- **Unlimited users.** SocialBee charges \$10/mo per extra user. Even their Pro plan (3 users) at \$99/mo is comparable to our Pro (\$100/mo) but with user and profile caps.
- **More platforms.** We support 14 including Discord, Slack, Mastodon, and Bluesky. SocialBee covers 9.
- **Developer tools.** SDK, webhooks, OpenAPI spec.
- **No workspace limits.** SocialBee caps workspaces (1-5 on standard plans, more on agency). Our teams are unlimited.

## The Pricing Reality

| Scenario | bundle.social | SocialBee |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 user, 5 profiles | \$100/mo (Pro) | \$29/mo (Bootstrap) |
| 1 user, 10 profiles | \$100/mo (Pro) | \$49/mo (Accelerate) |
| 3 users, 25 profiles | \$100/mo (Pro) | \$99/mo (Pro) |
| 5 users, 50 profiles | \$400/mo (Business) | \$179/mo (Pro50) + \$20 extra users |
| 5 users, 100 profiles | \$400/mo (Business) | \$329/mo (Pro100) + \$20 extra users |
| API access | \$100/mo (Pro) | Not available |

SocialBee is cheaper for small setups with fewer profiles. At 25+ profiles with 3+ users, the pricing converges. At 50+ profiles, we're comparable. The API is the dealbreaker.
