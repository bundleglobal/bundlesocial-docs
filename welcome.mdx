## Welcome to bundle.social

**The Unified Social Media API designed for unlimited scalability.**

**Building social media integrations sucks.** 

You have to deal with 14 different APIs, 14 different authentication flows, random breaking changes, and documentation that was written by a insider robot in 2013.

**We fixed it.**

bundle.social provides a single, unified API for:
*   **Unlimited Social Accounts:** Connect 1 or 10,000 accounts. We don't punish you for growing.
*   **Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter/X, Pinterest, Reddit, Threads, Mastodon, Bluesky, Discord, Slack, and Google Business.**
*   **Scheduling & Publishing:** Post images, videos, reels, and stories.
*   **Analytics:** Get normalized data (views, likes, impressions) and demographic insights across platforms.
*   **Authentication:** We handle the OAuth nightmares and token refreshes for you.

You build the product. We handle the platforms.
