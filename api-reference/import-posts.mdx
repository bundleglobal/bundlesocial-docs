Empty dashboards are sad. Use the History Import API to fetch existing content from connected accounts.

## How it works
This is an **asynchronous** job. You don't get the posts instantly.
1.  **Start:** You trigger a job ("Go fetch 50 posts from Instagram").
2.  **Wait:** We queue it, talk to the platform, and crunch the data.
3.  **Poll:** You check if we're done.
4.  **Fetch:** You download the results.

## Step 1: Start the Job
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/post-history-import`

```json
{
  "teamId": "team_123",
  "socialAccountType": "INSTAGRAM",
  "count": 50, // Max 100 per batch
  "withAnalytics": true
}
```

**Limits:**
*   **Free:** 5 posts / month (Demo mode)
*   **Pro:** 100 posts / month
*   **Business:** 250 posts / month

<Note>
**Why limits?** Historical imports are expensive on API tokens. We have to be stingy here to keep the service cheap for everyone.
</Note>

## Step 2: Check Status
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/post-history-import?teamId=...`

You'll see a list of jobs with statuses:
*   `PENDING`: In queue.
*   `FETCHING_POSTS`: Talking to Instagram...
*   `COMPLETED`: Done!
*   `FAILED`: Something exploded.
*   `RATE_LIMITED`: Platform said "slow down". We paused it for you.

---

## Step 3: Get the Loot
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/post-history-import/posts`

Once status is `COMPLETED`, call this to get the actual data.

```json
{
  "posts": [
    {
      "title": "My Cat Video",
      "analytics": {
        "likes": 1337,
        "impressions": 42000
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Handling Rate Limits
If a job hits `RATE_LIMITED`, don't panic. It means we hit the platform's cap (e.g. LinkedIn API limits).
*   We automatically pause the job.
*   We set a `rateLimitResetAt` timestamp.
*   You can retry it after that time.
