Empty dashboards are sad. Use the History Import API to fetch existing content from connected accounts.

- You can filter imports by **surface** and **media type**.
- You can request richer media metadata in `extraData` (when platform returns direct media URLs).
- `extraData` is now normalized as `extraData.media[]`.
- For platforms/endpoints that do not expose direct media URLs (e.g. current YouTube import path), `extraData` is `null`.

## How it works
This is an **asynchronous** job. You don't get the posts instantly.
1.  **Start:** You trigger a job ("Go fetch 50 posts from Instagram").
2.  **Wait:** We queue it, talk to the platform, and crunch the data.
3.  **Poll:** You check if we're done.
4.  **Fetch:** You download the results.

---

## Step 1: Start the Job
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/post-history-import`

```json
{
  "teamId": "team_123",
  "socialAccountType": "INSTAGRAM",
  "count": 50,
  "withAnalytics": true,
  "importCarousels": true,
  "surface": "ALL",
  "mediaType": "VIDEO"
}
```

### Import filters and media options

- `surface` lets you choose where the content comes from (`ALL`, `PROFILE_GRID`, `NON_GRID`, `STORY`).
- `mediaType` filters by content type (`VIDEO` or `IMAGE`).
- `importCarousels` controls whether carousel child media is expanded into `extraData.media[]` when supported.

<Note>
Platform APIs are inconsistent. Some filters/surfaces may return no data on specific platforms if that API does not expose that view.
</Note>

**Limits:**
*   **Free:** 5 posts / month (Demo mode)
*   **Pro:** 100 posts / month
*   **Business:** 250 posts / month

<Note>
**Why limits?** Historical imports are expensive on API tokens. We have to be stingy here to keep the service cheap for everyone.
</Note>

### Imported post analytics

By default, imported posts get an **initial analytics snapshot** at import time when `withAnalytics: true`.

#### Ongoing Analytics Refresh

Imported posts can also be added to the regular analytics refresh cycle - meaning they get updated on the same schedule as posts created through bundle.social.

This is controlled by an organization-level setting. When enabled:

- Imported posts are included in the regular analytics scanner.
- You can fetch analytics for imported posts via the standard analytics endpoints using `importedPostId` instead of `postId`.
- You can force-refresh analytics for imported posts the same way you would for regular posts.

<Note>
**`importedPostId` vs `postId`:** When querying analytics for imported posts, use `importedPostId` (the imported post's ID). Don't mix it with `postId` + `platformType` - they're mutually exclusive.
</Note>

<Warning>
Ongoing analytics for imported posts means we're making additional API calls to platforms for posts that weren't created through bundle.social. 

Want to enable this? [Contact us](https://bundle.social/contact) and we'll set it up for your organization, but there will be some fee tho ❤️
</Warning>

## Step 2: Check Status
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/post-history-import?teamId=...`

You'll see a list of jobs with statuses:
*   `PENDING`: In queue.
*   `FETCHING_POSTS`: Talking to Instagram...
*   `COMPLETED`: Done!
*   `FAILED`: Something exploded.
*   `RATE_LIMITED`: Platform said "slow down". We paused it for you.

---

## Step 3: Get the Loot
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/post-history-import/posts`

Once status is `COMPLETED`, call this to get the actual data.

```json
{
  "posts": [
    {
      "title": "My Cat Video",
      "type": "VIDEO",
      "extraData": null,
      "analytics": {
        "likes": 1337,
        "impressions": 42000
      }
    },
    {
      "title": "Carousel example",
      "type": "IMAGE",
      "extraData": {
        "media": [
          {
            "id": "1789...",
            "mediaUrl": "https://cdn.platform.com/media/..."
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### `extraData` structure

When available, imported posts include:

```json
{
  "extraData": {
    "media": [
      {
        "id": "platform-media-id-or-null",
        "mediaUrl": "direct-platform-media-url"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

If we can't get direct media URLs from the platform endpoint, `extraData` is `null`.

<Note>
Current YouTube history import returns `extraData: null`.
</Note>

## Handling Rate Limits
If a job hits `RATE_LIMITED`, don't panic. It means we hit the platform's cap (e.g. LinkedIn API limits).
*   We automatically pause the job.
*   We set a `rateLimitResetAt` timestamp.
*   You can retry it after that time.
