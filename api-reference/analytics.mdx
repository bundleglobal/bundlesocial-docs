## Analytics Refresh & Rate Limits

### Force Refresh

You can request analytics to be refreshed immediately by calling the analytics endpoint with a force parameter. 
However, force refresh requests are rate limited to amout of teams * 5 to prevent excessive API calls to social platforms.
You may ask why?
To protect US from our greatest and brightest vibe code engineers doing: 

```typescript
while (true) {
  await bundlesocial.analytics.analyticsForceRefresh({
    teamId: team.id,
  });
}
```
we had such cases...

<Note>
**Rate Limit Formula**: Maximum force refresh requests = `number of teams × 5`

For example, if you have 10 teams, you can make up to 50 force refresh requests.
</Note>

### Custom Refresh Periods

By default, analytics are automatically refreshed every **24 hours**. However, we can configure custom refresh periods based on your organization's needs.

**Important**: If you require a higher refresh rate (e.g., every 15 minutes for large organizations), there may be additional charges due to increased data costs. 
We will discuss these costs with you directly to determine the best solution for your use case. Nothing expensive/outlandish etc..., we are not evil. 
Maybe you will need to skip on OF subscription but you know, economy...

## Data Retention

We retain analytics data for 40 days from the date of creation. If your team needs yearly or long-term history, we recommend fetching and storing the data daily on your end. 
This retention period is fixed and will not be extended. Maybe we are evil?

## Important Note: Data Differences

<Note>
**Data shown in our platform may differ from what you see on the social media platform itself.** This can happen for several reasons:

- **Processing Delays**: Platforms may take time to process and return analytics data. For example, TikTok can take up to 48 hours for some detailed analytics like audience demographics and splits.

- **Rolling Window Timing**: When platforms return rolling window data, the exact time window and aggregation method may differ slightly from what's displayed in their native interfaces.

- **Data Availability**: Some metrics may be available in the platform's native interface but not through their API, or vice versa.

- **Update Frequency**: Analytics are updated based on when we fetch data from each platform, which may not match the real-time updates you see in the platform's own interface.
</Note>

## Understanding analytics

This is what we return to you in aggregated form, it ain't much but it's honest work.

- **Rolling Window**: Analytics show aggregated data over a fixed time period (e.g., last 30 days) that updates as time progresses. Each time you view analytics, you see data for the most recent period.

- **Lifetime**: Analytics show a snapshot of cumulative totals from when the post or profile was created up to the current moment. These values represent the current state and will continue to grow over time.
Nothing new.

## Notes

- **Rolling Window**: Data refreshes to show the most recent period (e.g., last 30 days). Each time you check analytics, you see data for the current rolling period.
- **Lifetime**: Data represents cumulative totals from creation to now. These values are snapshots of the current state and will continue to grow.
- Some platforms have date restrictions due to API limitations (e.g., Threads requires posts after April 2024).
- LinkedIn has significant differences between personal and organization account analytics capabilities.
- Metrics may vary slightly between platforms due to how each platform defines and tracks engagement.

## Raw Analytics Data

In addition to the parsed analytics data described above, raw analytics data is also available. Raw analytics contain the unparsed, original data returned directly from each platform's API. This includes:

- Platform-specific metrics that may not be mapped to our standard schema
- Additional metadata and context provided by the platform
- Detailed breakdowns (e.g., audience demographics, engagement by time period, etc.)

Raw analytics can be useful for advanced analysis or when you need access to platform-specific metrics that aren't included in the standardized analytics format. Note that raw data structure and fields vary significantly between platforms.
BTW, you are a nerd for reading all of this.
