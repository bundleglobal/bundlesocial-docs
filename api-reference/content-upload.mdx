# How to upload your content

bundle.social supports two methods for uploading media files. A **three-step upload flow** for large files and an **alternative simple upload** for smaller files.

---

## Method 1: Three-Step Upload Flow (recommended, please use it)

This method uses a pre-signed URL and is ideal for large video files or when you need more control over the upload process.

### Step 1 – Initialize

**Endpoint:** `POST /upload/init`  

**Swagger:** `upload.initLargeUpload`

**Parameters**

- `fileName` (**required**) — The name of the file you want to upload

- `mimeType` (**required**) — The MIME type of your file. Supported values:

  - **Images:** `image/jpg`, `image/jpeg`, `image/png`

  - **Videos:** `video/mp4`

- `teamId` (optional) — The team ID to associate this upload with. If not provided, the upload is visible org‑wide to all teams.

**Response**

```json
{
  "url": "<upload target – use PUT with the binary file>",
  "path": "<internal reference to pass to finalize>"
}
```

**Example using SDK**

```ts
const initResponse = await bundlesocial.upload.initLargeUpload({
  requestBody: {
    fileName: 'promo.mp4',
    mimeType: 'video/mp4',
    teamId: team.id, // optional
  }
});

// Save these values for the next steps
const { url, path } = initResponse;
```

---

### Step 2 – Upload

Send a **PUT** request with the **binary file as the raw body** to the provided `url` from Step 1.

<Note>
The PUT target `url` is a one-time upload location. Do **not** JSON‑encode the file. Send the file bytes directly as the raw body.
</Note>

**Example using cURL**

```bash
# Replace <URL_FROM_STEP_1> with the exact 'url' you received
curl -X PUT "<URL_FROM_STEP_1>" \
  --upload-file ./promo.mp4
```

**Example using fetch**

```ts
const fileBuffer = await fs.readFile('./promo.mp4');

await fetch(url, {
  method: 'PUT',
  body: fileBuffer,
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'video/mp4',
  },
});
```

---

### Step 3 – Finalize

**Endpoint:** `POST /upload/finalize`  

**Swagger:** `upload.finalizeLargeUpload`

**Parameters**

- `path` (**required**) — The `path` value returned in Step 1

- `teamId` (optional) — The team ID (should match the one used in Step 1)

**Response**

Returns the **created upload entity** with an `id` that you can use when creating posts.

**Example using SDK**

```ts
const finalizedUpload = await bundlesocial.upload.finalizeLargeUpload({
  requestBody: {
    path: path, // from Step 1
    teamId: team.id, // optional
  }
});

// Use finalizedUpload.id when creating posts
const uploadId = finalizedUpload.id;
```

---

## Method 2: Simple Upload (Alternative approach)

This is a simpler, one-step upload method ideal for smaller files. It uses a standard multipart/form-data upload.

**Endpoint:** `POST /upload/create`  

**Swagger:** `upload.create`

**Parameters**

- `file` (**required**) — The file to upload (multipart form data)

- `teamId` (optional) — The team ID to associate this upload with

**Response**

Returns the **created upload entity** with an `id` that you can use when creating posts.

**Example using SDK**

```ts
const video = await fs.readFile('./video.mp4');
const videoUpload = await bundlesocial.upload.uploadCreate({
  formData: {
    teamId: team.id,
    file: new Blob([video], { type: 'video/mp4' }),
  }
});

const jpgImage = await fs.readFile('./image.jpg');
const jpgUpload = await bundlesocial.upload.uploadCreate({
  formData: {
    teamId: team.id,
    file: new Blob([jpgImage], { type: 'image/jpeg' }),
  }
});

// Use the upload IDs when creating posts
console.log(videoUpload.id, jpgUpload.id);
```

**Example using cURL**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.bundle.social/upload/create" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -F "file=@./image.jpg" \
  -F "teamId=YOUR_TEAM_ID"
```

<Note>
The simple upload method is easier to implement but may have file size limitations. For large video files (>90MB), we recommend using the three-step upload flow.
</Note>

## Supported file types

| Media Type | MIME Type | Extension |
| ---------- | --------- | --------- |
| JPEG Image | `image/jpeg` or `image/jpg` | `.jpg`, `.jpeg` |
| PNG Image | `image/png` | `.png` |
| MP4 Video | `video/mp4` | `.mp4` |

<Note>
**Maximum file sizes:**
- Images: **25MB**
- Videos: **1024MB** (1GB)
</Note>

## Which method should I use?

- **Use the three-step flow** when:
  - Uploading large video files (>90MB)
  - You need more control over the upload process
  - You are uploading picture of your mom

- **Use the simple upload** when:
  - Uploading small to medium-sized files
  - You want a simpler implementation
  - File size is under 90MB
  - You're prototyping or building a simple integration
