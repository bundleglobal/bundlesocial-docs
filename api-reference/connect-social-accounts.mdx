Connecting social accounts is the hardest part of any integration because OAuth flows are pain. We offer two ways to handle this.

## 1. The Easy Way (Hosted Flow)

We host the UI. You just send the user to a link, they click buttons, and get redirected back to you.

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/social-account/create-portal-link`

Test it in [Swagger](https://api.bundle.social/swagger#/socialAccount/socialAccount.createPortalLink) or the [API Reference Client](/api-reference/client/socialaccount/create-portal-link).

### Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `teamId` | Yes | The team ID to connect the social accounts to. |
| `redirectUrl` | Yes | The URL to redirect to after clicking the back button. |
| `socialAccountTypes` | Yes | The social account types to connect (e.g. `['INSTAGRAM', 'LINKEDIN']`). |
| `logoUrl` | No | The URL of the logo to display on the top of the page. |
| `userLogoUrl` | No | The URL of the user logo/avatar to display. |
| `userName` | No | The name of the user to display. |
| `goBackButtonText` | No | The text of the back button. |
| `language` | No | The language of the page. |
| `hidePoweredBy` | No | Whether to hide the "powered by" text. |

| `hideUserLogo` | No | Whether to hide the user logo. |

## 2. The Hard Way (Custom UI)
You build the UI. You trigger the OAuth flows. You look like a hero.

### Connect Social Account Flow

For most platforms, the flow is straightforward. The exceptions are **YouTube**, **Facebook**, **Instagram**, **LinkedIn**, and **Google Business** where you need to select a channel after the initial connection.

<Note>
**Channel Selection Required:**
- **YouTube:** Select a YouTube channel.
- **Facebook:** Select a Facebook Page.
- **Instagram:** Select an Instagram account (connected to a Facebook Page).
- **LinkedIn:** Select a LinkedIn Company Page.
- **Google Business:** Select a business location.
</Note>
