Connecting social accounts is the hardest part of any integration because OAuth flows are pain. We offer two ways to handle this.

## 1. The Easy Way (Hosted Flow)
We host the UI. You just send the user to a link, they click buttons, and get redirected back to you.

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/social-account/create-portal-link`

You provide:
*   `teamId`: Where the account belongs.
*   `redirectUrl`: Where to send them back (e.g. `https://yourapp.com/callback`).
*   `socialAccountTypes`: What they should connect (e.g. `['INSTAGRAM', 'LINKEDIN']`).

**Result:**
You get a URL. Redirect the user there. They see this beautiful page:

When they finish, we send them back to your `redirectUrl` with success (or error) flags.

## 2. The Hard Way (Custom UI)
You build the UI. You trigger the OAuth flows. You look like a hero.

**The Flow:**
1.  You call our API to get an authorization URL for a specific platform (e.g. LinkedIn).
2.  You redirect the user there.
3.  They accept permissions.
4.  They are redirected back to your app.

<Note>
**Platform Specifics:**
Some platforms (YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn) require a **second step**. After the user connects their "Account", they must select a specific "Page" or "Channel" to use. You need to build a UI for this selection.

## Handling Callbacks

Whether you use Hosted or Custom, the user eventually comes back to your URL with query parameters.

### Success Parameters
We append flags like `?instagram-callback=success` to your URL.

*   `twitter-callback`
*   `linkedin-callback`
*   `instagram-callback`
*   ...and so on.

### Error Parameters
If things go wrong (and they will), we tell you why.

**Common Errors:**
*   `*-not-enough-permissions`: User clicked "Cancel" or uncheck required boxes.
*   `*-not-enough-pages`: User connected Facebook but has no Pages.
*   `*-callback`: Generic error (timeout, provider error).

**Example URL:**
`https://yourapp.com/callback?facebook-callback=error&facebook-not-enough-pages=true`

<Tip>
**Pro Tip:** Always handle the `not-enough-permissions` error gracefully. Tell the user: *"Hey, we need those permissions to actually post. Please try again and don't uncheck the boxes."*
