## Hosted by you

It enables you to connect social accounts directly through your app, but required more work to set up.

### Connect social account flow
![Connect social account flow](/images/api-reference/connect-social-account/connect-social-account.png)

For most of the platforms flow is pretty simple.
The only exception are Youtube, Facebook, Instagram and Linkedin where you need to select the channel after the initial connection. Channel in this context means different things for different platforms:

- For Youtube it's a Youtube channel.
- For Facebook it's a Facebook page.
- For Instagram it's an Instagram account.
- For LinkedIn it's a LinkedIn page.
