## Authentication

We use standard Bearer Token authentication. Simple, secure, boring.

<Note>
  **Don't have an API Key?**  
  [Sign up here](https://bundle.social) and grab one from the **API Keys** section in your dashboard.
</Note>

### The Header

To make a request, add the `x-api-key` header with your key.

```json
{
  "x-api-key": "pk_live_..."
}
```

### Authorization Scheme

All endpoints are protected. If you don't send the key, you get a `401 Unauthorized`. If you send a bad key, you get a `403 Forbidden`.

```json
"security": [
  { 
    "ApiKeyAuth": [] 
  }
]
```

## Base URL

```bash
https://api.bundle.social
```

Everything is prefixed with `/api/v1` usually, but check the specific endpoint reference.

## Rate Limits

We have sensible rate limits to protect the system. If you hit them, you'll get a `429 Too Many Requests`.
*   **Standard:** 600 requests / minute per IP.
*   **Platform Specific:** Posting limits depend on the social network (e.g. you can't post 100 TikToks in an hour).

Check the [Rate Limits](/api-reference/rate-limits) page for the nitty-gritty details.
