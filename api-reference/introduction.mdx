## Authentication

We use API Key authentication. Simple, secure, boring.

<Note>
  **Don't have an API Key?**  
  [Sign up here](https://bundle.social) and grab one from the **API Keys** section in your dashboard.
</Note>

### The Header

To make a request, add the `x-api-key` header with your key.

```json
{
  "x-api-key": "pk_live_..."
}
```

### Authorization Scheme

All endpoints are protected. If you don't send the key, you get a `401 Unauthorized`. If you send a bad key, you get a `403 Forbidden`.

```json
"security": [
  { 
    "ApiKeyAuth": [] 
  }
]
```

## Base URL

```bash
https://api.bundle.social
```

Everything is prefixed with `/api/v1`, but check the specific endpoint reference to be sure.

## Organizations vs Teams

This is important. Almost every API call involves a `teamId`, so you need to understand the hierarchy:

```
Organization (your account)
  ├── Team A (e.g. "Marketing")
  │   ├── Social Accounts (Instagram, TikTok, ...)
  │   ├── Posts
  │   └── Uploads
  ├── Team B (e.g. "Client: Acme Corp")
  │   ├── Social Accounts
  │   ├── Posts
  │   └── Uploads
  ├── API Keys (shared across all teams)
  ├── Webhooks (shared across all teams)
  └── Subscription & Billing
```

### What lives where

| Level | What belongs here |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Organization** | API keys, webhooks, subscription/billing, compression settings |
| **Team** | Social accounts, posts, uploads, bots, invitations, bio/link-in-bio |

### Why this matters for you

- **`teamId` is required** on most endpoints (creating posts, uploading media, connecting accounts). Think of a team as a "workspace" or "project" - it groups related social accounts together.
- **API keys are org-level.** One key gives you access to all teams in the organization.
- **Webhooks are org-level.** You get events for all teams from a single webhook endpoint.
- **Rate limits are per team.** Each team has its own daily posting quota. Five teams means five independent limits. See [Rate Limits](/api-reference/rate-limits).
- **Monthly post caps are org-level.** The total monthly posts across all teams are capped by your subscription tier.

<Tip>
If you're building a SaaS where each of your customers needs their own social accounts, create a **team per customer**. They won't step on each other's toes.
</Tip>

## Rate Limits

We have sensible rate limits to protect the system. If you hit them, you'll get a `429 Too Many Requests`.

Check the [Rate Limits](/api-reference/rate-limits) page for the full breakdown - including burst protection, per-minute caps, and daily posting limits per platform.
