## No Account Limits

bundle.social is a unified social media API built for scale. Unlike other social media management APIs, we don't charge per connected account or punish you for growing. Connect 1 account or 10,000 accounts - same flat pricing. Our API supports Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Pinterest, Reddit, Threads, Mastodon, Bluesky, Discord, Slack, and Google Business Profile. Perfect for SaaS platforms, agencies, and enterprise applications that need unlimited social media integrations.

## API Rate Limits

We use a multi-layer throttling system to keep things fair and prevent bursts from taking down the ranch. Limits are tracked **per API key** (which means per organization), per bearer token (per user), or per IP as a fallback.

### The Three Layers

| Layer | Window | Max Requests | What it prevents |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Burst** | 1 second | 100 | Someone doing `Promise.all()` with 500 requests |
| **Short** | 10 seconds | 500 | Aggressive polling or runaway loops |
| **Minute** | 1 minute | 2,000 | Sustained high-volume abuse |

All three layers are enforced simultaneously. You could theoretically do 2,000 requests in a minute, but not 200 of them in the same second.

<Warning>
**Easy there, cowboy.** If you hit any of these limits, you'll get a `429 Too Many Requests`. Take a breath, wait a moment, and try again. We're not going anywhere.
</Warning>

### How tracking works

We identify you in this order:

1. **API Key** (`x-api-key` header) - one API key = one organization
2. **Bearer Token** (`Authorization` header) - one token = one user
3. **IP Address** - fallback if neither of the above is present

This means all requests from the same API key share the same bucket, regardless of which server or IP they come from. If you have microservices all using the same key, they share the limit.

<Note>
We don't return rate limit headers (`X-RateLimit-Remaining`, etc.) at this time. If you're getting 429s, just back off. Exponential backoff is your friend.
</Note>

## External Platform Rate Limits

These are **daily limits per social account** within a team. Each connected social account has its own independent quota that resets every 24 hours.

### Posting daily limits per platform per tier

| Platform | FREE | PRO | BUSINESS | 
| -------- | ---- | --- | -------- |
| TWITTER  | 5 | 15 | 15 |
| FACEBOOK  | 10 | 24 | 36 |
| INSTAGRAM  | 10 | 20 | 25 |
| LINKEDIN  | 10 | 18 | 24 |
| YOUTUBE  | 10 | 10 | 15 |
| TIKTOK  | 5 | 10 | 15 |
| THREADS  | 10 | 200 | 250 |
| PINTEREST  | 10 | 24 | 36 |
| REDDIT  | 10 | 24 | 36 |
| DISCORD  | 10 | 100 | 200 |
| SLACK  | 10 | 100 | 200 |
| MASTODON  | 10 | 50 | 100 |
| BLUESKY  | 10 | 50 | 100 |
| GOOGLE_BUSINESS  | 10 | 20 | 40 |

<Note>
**Example:** You're on the Pro tier and have 5 teams, each connected to TikTok. Each team can post up to 10 TikToks per day independently. That's 50 TikToks total across your org per day. The limit is per team, per platform, per day - not shared.
</Note>

### Monthly post limits (organization-wide)

On top of daily limits, there are monthly caps across the entire organization:

| Tier | Monthly Posts |
| ---- | ------------- |
| FREE | 10 |
| PRO | 1,000 |
| BUSINESS | 100,000 |
