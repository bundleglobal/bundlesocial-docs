## Our rate limits
<Note>
  We don't use rate limits per endpoint, we use rate limits per user. This means that if you exceed the rate limit on one endpoint, you will be rate limited on all endpoints. You will receive a 429 status code if you exceed the rate limit.
</Note>

**Rate limit is**: 5000 requests per minute
