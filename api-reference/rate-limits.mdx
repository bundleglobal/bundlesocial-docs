## No Account Limits

bundle.social is a unified social media API built for scale. Unlike other social media management APIs, we don't charge per connected account or punish you for growing. Connect 1 account or 10,000 accounts - same flat pricing. Our API supports Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Pinterest, Reddit, Threads, Mastodon, Bluesky, Discord, Slack, and Google Business Profile. Perfect for SaaS platforms, agencies, and enterprise applications that need unlimited social media integrations.

## API Rate Limits

We use a multi-layer throttling system to keep things fair and prevent bursts from taking down the ranch. Limits are tracked **per endpoint** and per tracker: **API key** (organization), **bearer token** (user), or **IP** as fallback.

### The Three Layers

| Layer | Window | Max Requests | Theoretical equivalent | What it prevents |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Burst** | 1 second | 100 | 6,000 / minute | Someone doing `Promise.all()` with 500 requests |
| **Short** | 10 seconds | 500 | 3,000 / minute | Aggressive polling or runaway loops |
| **Minute** | 1 minute | 2,000 | 2,000 / minute | Sustained high-volume abuse |

All three layers are enforced simultaneously. For sustained traffic, the **minute** layer (2,000/min) is the effective cap.

<Note>
Because limits are per endpoint, heavy traffic on `POST /post` does not consume the same bucket as `GET /analytics` for the same tracker.
</Note>

<Warning>
**Easy there, cowboy.** If you hit any of these limits, you'll get a `429 Too Many Requests`. Take a breath, wait a moment, and try again. We're not going anywhere.
</Warning>

## External Platform Rate Limits

These are **daily limits per social account** within a team. Each connected social account has its own independent quota that resets every 24 hours.

### Posting daily limits per platform per tier

| Platform | FREE | PRO | BUSINESS | 
| -------- | ---- | --- | -------- |
| TWITTER  | 5 | 15 | 15 |
| FACEBOOK  | 10 | 24 | 36 |
| INSTAGRAM  | 10 | 20 | 25 |
| LINKEDIN  | 10 | 18 | 24 |
| YOUTUBE  | 10 | 10 | 15 |
| TIKTOK  | 5 | 10 | 15 |
| THREADS  | 10 | 200 | 250 |
| PINTEREST  | 10 | 24 | 36 |
| REDDIT  | 10 | 24 | 36 |
| DISCORD  | 10 | 100 | 200 |
| SLACK  | 10 | 100 | 200 |
| MASTODON  | 10 | 50 | 100 |
| BLUESKY  | 10 | 50 | 100 |
| GOOGLE_BUSINESS  | 10 | 20 | 40 |

<Note>
**Example:** You're on the Pro tier and have 5 teams, each connected to TikTok. Each team can post up to 10 TikToks per day independently. That's 50 TikToks total across your org per day. The limit is per team, per platform, per day - not shared.
</Note>

### Monthly post limits (organization-wide)

On top of daily limits, there are monthly caps across the entire organization:

| Tier | Monthly Posts |
| ---- | ------------- |
| FREE | 10 |
| PRO | 1,000 |
| BUSINESS | 100,000 |
