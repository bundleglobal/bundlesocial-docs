The platform formerly known as Twitter. The API changes have been... eventful. Let's focus on what works.

## Supported Content Types

*   **Tweets:** Text with optional media. 0-4 files.
*   Images and videos can be mixed in the same tweet.

## Quirks & Gotchas

### Media Limits
*   Max 4 images per tweet.
*   Max 4 videos per tweet (though realistically, 1 is most common).
*   Video max size: 512 MB.

### Subscription-Based Limits
Twitter/X limits vary based on the account's subscription tier:

| Tier | Text Limit | Video Duration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Free | 280 chars | 140s (2:20) |
| Basic | 280 chars | 140s (2:20) |
| Premium | 25,000 chars | 600s (10 min) |
| Premium+ | 25,000 chars | 600s (10 min) |

See [Platform Limits](/api-reference/limits#twitter--x) for the full breakdown.

## Analytics

We'll be honest here.

### Profile Analytics
**Status:** Not available. Won't be.

### Post Analytics
**Status:** Not available. Won't be.

<Info>
**Why?** The X API changes have made analytics access extremely expensive and restrictive. The cost-to-value ratio doesn't make sense for anyone involved. We know, it sucks. If this changes in the future, we'll add support. But don't hold your breath.
