Threads is the new kid on the block, integrated tightly with Instagram's infrastructure. The API is surprisingly decent for a platform this young.

## Supported Content Types

*   **Text Posts:** Text only, or text with images/videos. 0-10 files.
*   **Mixed Media:** Images and videos can be combined in the same post. Up to 10 items.

## Quirks & Gotchas

### Terminology
*   **Comments** are called **Replies** in Threads-land.
*   **Shares** include both **Reposts** and **Quotes**. We combine them into one number.

### Date Restrictions
Threads requires posts to be after **April 2024** for analytics. Older imported posts won't have analytics data.

## Analytics

For general analytics concepts (refresh rates, data retention, what "Returns 0" means), see the [Analytics Overview](/api-reference/analytics).

### Profile Analytics
**Period:** Rolling window.

| Metric | Description | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `impressions` | Content impressions | Internally contains quote count from API |
| `impressionsUnique` | Unique impressions | Internally contains repost count from API |
| `views` | Views | |
| `viewsUnique` | - | Same as views |
| `likes` | Likes | |
| `comments` | Replies | |
| `postCount` | Total posts | |
| `followers` | Followers | |
| `following` | - | Returns `0` (not provided by Threads API) |

### Post Analytics
**Period:** Lifetime.

| Metric | Description | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `impressions` | Views | |
| `impressionsUnique` | - | Same as impressions |
| `views` | Views | Same as impressions |
| `viewsUnique` | - | Same as views |
| `likes` | Likes | |
| `comments` | Replies | |
| `shares` | Reposts + Quotes | Combined into one number |

### Quirks
- Views metric is used for both impressions and views (they are the same value).
- Comments are called "replies" in Threads.
- Shares include both reposts and quotes - we don't split them.
- For profile analytics: the impressions field internally contains quote counts and impressionsUnique contains repost counts. This is how the Threads API returns data.
- Following count is not available through the Threads API.
