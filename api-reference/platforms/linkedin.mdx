LinkedIn is unique because it strictly separates **Personal Profiles** (Members) from **Organization Pages** (Companies). The API treats them very differently.

## Quirks & Gotchas

### Personal vs. Organization
This is the biggest source of confusion.

*   **Personal Profile (Member):** Limited API. **Cannot import post history.** Limited analytics.
*   **Organization (Company Page):** Full API power. Richer analytics. Supports historical import.

### The URN Nightmre
LinkedIn uses "URNs" (Uniform Resource Names) to identify everything.
*   Organization: `urn:li:organization:12345`
*   Person: `urn:li:person:abcde`

If you are constructing raw text mentions, you need to use this format. Our API handles basic text automatically, but if you're getting fancy, keep this in mind.
