LinkedIn is unique because it strictly separates **Personal Profiles** (Members) from **Organization Pages** (Companies). The API treats them very differently, and this affects analytics significantly.

## Quirks & Gotchas

### Personal vs. Organization
This is the biggest source of confusion.

*   **Personal Profile (Member):** Limited API. **Cannot import post history.** Limited analytics. No profile views data.
*   **Organization (Company Page):** Full API power. Richer analytics. Supports historical import. Has page view data.

### The URN Nightmare
LinkedIn uses "URNs" (Uniform Resource Names) to identify everything.
*   Organization: `urn:li:organization:12345`
*   Person: `urn:li:person:abcde`

If you are constructing raw text mentions, you need to use this format. Our API handles basic text automatically, but if you're getting fancy, keep this in mind.

### Media Limits

Video max size is **2 GB** (not 200 MB - that was an old API limitation). Documents must be PDF format, max 100 MB.

See [Platform Limits](/api-reference/limits#linkedin) for the full breakdown.

### Quirks

- **Personal accounts** do NOT have views analytics for profiles - only organizations get page views.
- **Organization accounts** have page views for profile analytics but NOT for individual posts. Yes, it's confusing.
- Post count and following count are not provided through the LinkedIn API for either account type.
- Organization post analytics only include posts from the last 30 days.
