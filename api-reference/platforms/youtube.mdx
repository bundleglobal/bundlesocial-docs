YouTube is a beast. It handles both traditional long-form videos and Shorts (vertical video). The API is powerful but comes with legal requirements you can't ignore.

## Supported Content Types

*   **Videos:** Long-form content. 1 video, up to 4 hours. Max 256 GB (not a typo).
*   **Shorts:** Vertical/square video, max 3 minutes. YouTube auto-detects based on duration and aspect ratio.

## Quirks & Gotchas

### "Made for Kids" (COPPA)
This is not just a quirk, it's a **legal requirement**.
*   You **must** flag content as `madeForKids: true` if it targets children.
*   Failure to do so can result in penalties - real ones, from the FTC.
*   We expose this field in the `data.YOUTUBE` object. Use it. Don't skip it. Don't "figure it out later".

### Shorts Detection
There is no special "upload as Short" button. YouTube decides for you based on the file:
*   **Duration:** Under **3 minutes** (180 seconds).
*   **Aspect Ratio:** Vertical (9:16) or Square (1:1). Technically 1:3 to 1:1.

If your video meets these criteria, it becomes a Short. If it doesn't, it's a regular video.

### YouTube Title is Required
Unlike most platforms where you just need text, YouTube requires a **title** (`data.YOUTUBE.title`). If you forget it, the post will fail.

## Analytics

For general analytics concepts (refresh rates, data retention, what "Returns 0" means), see the [Analytics Overview](/api-reference/analytics).

YouTube analytics are all **Lifetime** values. There is no rolling window - everything is cumulative from day one.

### Profile (Channel) Analytics
**Period:** Lifetime.

| Metric | Description | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `impressions` | Total channel views | |
| `impressionsUnique` | - | Same as impressions (YouTube doesn't distinguish) |
| `views` | Total channel views | Same as impressions |
| `viewsUnique` | - | Same as views |
| `likes` | - | Returns `0` (not available at channel level) |
| `comments` | Total comments | Across all videos |
| `postCount` | Total videos | |
| `followers` | Subscribers | |
| `following` | - | Returns `0` (not applicable to channels) |

### Post (Video) Analytics
**Period:** Lifetime.

| Metric | Description | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `impressions` | Video views | |
| `impressionsUnique` | - | Same as impressions (YouTube doesn't distinguish) |
| `views` | Video views | Same as impressions |
| `viewsUnique` | - | Same as views |
| `likes` | Likes | |
| `dislikes` | Dislikes | Available via API even though YouTube hides them on the UI |
| `comments` | Comments | |
| `shares` | - | Returns `0` (not provided by YouTube API) |
| `saves` | Favorites | |

### Quirks
- YouTube doesn't distinguish between impressions and unique impressions at any level.
- Dislikes are available through the API (though YouTube no longer shows dislike counts publicly). Handy if you want to know the truth.
- Channel-level likes are not available. Post shares are not available. YouTube gives us a lot, but not everything.
