YouTube is a beast. It handles both traditional videos and Shorts (vertical video).

## Quirks & Gotchas

### "Made for Kids" (COPPA)
This is not just a quirk, it's a **legal requirement**.
*   You **must** flag content as `madeForKids: true` if it targets children.
*   Failure to do so can result in penalties. We expose this field in the `data.YOUTUBE` object. Use it.

### Shorts Detection
There is no special "upload as Short" button. YouTube decides for you based on the file:
*   **Duration:** Under 60 seconds.
*   **Aspect Ratio:** Vertical (9:16) or Square (1:1).

If your video meets these criteria, it becomes a Short. If it doesn't, it's a regular video. Simple.
