## Supported Platforms

We support a wide range of social platforms. Our goal is to unify them into a single, beautiful API, but let's be real-under the hood, they are all uniquely chaotic.

Here is the current roster:

## The "Unified" API Myth

We do our best to abstract away the differences, but sometimes a platform is just... special. 

*   **Aspect Ratios:** Instagram will reject your Reel if it's not 9:16. We can't fix that for you.
*   **Rate Limits:** We handle queuing, but if you blast 100 posts in a second, things will slow down.
*   **Analytics:** Some platforms give us everything (TikTok), others give us crumbs (Reddit). We return `0` when data isn't available, rather than making numbers up.

Dive into each platform's guide to see the specific quirks, gotchas, and limitations. We've documented them so you don't have to discover them at 3 AM.
