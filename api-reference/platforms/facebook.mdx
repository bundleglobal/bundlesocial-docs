The OG social network. It's robust, but it carries a lot of legacy baggage.

## Supported Content Types

*   **Page Posts:** Text, Link, Image, Video.
*   **Reels:** Vertical video for Pages.

## Quirks & Gotchas

### Page Tokens Expire (Important!)
Facebook Page Access Tokens typically expire after **60 days**. 

<Note>
**This is not a bug, it's a feature.** If a user changes their password or security settings, the token dies immediately. You need to build your app to handle re-connection flows gracefully. We handle automatic refreshing where possible, but we can't perform miracles.
</Note>

### Reels Limitations
Facebook Reels via API are a bit stricter than mobile uploads:
*   No "Remix" functionality available via API.

## Analytics

### Profile Analytics
**Period:** Rolling window (30 days).

<Info>
**Why so many zeros?** To avoid hitting Facebook's aggressive rate limits, we've disabled fetching profile-level likes, comments, and post counts. We'd have to scan every single post on your page to get these, and Facebook would block us (and you).
