The OG social network. It's robust, but it carries a lot of legacy baggage. And rate limits. So many rate limits.

## Supported Content Types

*   **Page Posts:** Text, Link, Image, Video. 0-10 files.
*   **Reels:** Vertical video for Pages. 1 video.
*   **Stories:** Image or video. 1 file.

## Quirks & Gotchas

### Page Tokens Expire (Important!)
Facebook Page Access Tokens typically expire after **60 days**. 

<Note>
**This is not a bug, it's a feature.** If a user changes their password or security settings, the token dies immediately. You need to build your app to handle re-connection flows gracefully. We handle automatic refreshing where possible, but we can't perform miracles. If the token dies, the user needs to reconnect.
</Note>

### Reels Limitations
Facebook Reels via API are stricter than mobile uploads:
*   No "Remix" functionality available via API.
*   Duration: **3 seconds to 8 minutes** (480s). Not 60s - that's Stories.
*   Minimum resolution: 540x960.

### Media Limits

See [Platform Limits](/api-reference/limits#facebook) for the full breakdown of file sizes, resolutions, aspect ratios, and bitrates.

## Analytics

For general analytics concepts (refresh rates, data retention, what "Returns 0" means), see the [Analytics Overview](/api-reference/analytics).

### Profile Analytics
**Period:** Rolling window (30 days).

<Info>
**Why so many zeros?** To avoid hitting Facebook's aggressive rate limits, we've disabled fetching profile-level likes, comments, and post counts. We'd have to scan every single post on your page to get these, and Facebook would block us (and you). It's not worth it.
</Info>

| Metric | Description | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `impressions` | Total impressions | |
| `impressionsUnique` | Unique users reached | Uses 28-day period to avoid overcounting |
| `views` | Page views | |
| `viewsUnique` | - | Returns `0` (not provided by API) |
| `likes` | - | Returns `0` (disabled to save rate limits) |
| `comments` | - | Returns `0` (disabled to save rate limits) |
| `postCount` | - | Returns `0` (disabled to save rate limits) |
| `followers` | Page followers | |
| `following` | - | Returns `0` (not applicable to Pages) |

### Post Analytics
**Period:** Lifetime (Snapshot).

| Metric | Description | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `impressions` | Total impressions | |
| `impressionsUnique` | Unique impressions | |
| `views` | Video views | Video posts only |
| `viewsUnique` | Unique video views | Video posts only |
| `likes` | Total reactions | Aggregates Like, Love, Wow, Haha, Anger |
| `comments` | Total comments | |
| `shares` | Total shares | |
| `saves` | Total saves | |

### Reaction Aggregation
When we say "Likes" for Facebook, we mean **all reactions** combined. Whether someone Loved it, Hated it (Anger), or Laughed at it (Haha) - it all counts as one `likes` number. We don't break down reaction types in the standard schema. If you need that granularity, check the [raw analytics data](/api-reference/analytics#raw-analytics-data).
