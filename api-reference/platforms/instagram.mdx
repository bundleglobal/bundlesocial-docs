Instagram is visually demanding. The API reflects that. If you don't follow their rules on aspect ratios and media types, they will reject your content without mercy.

## Supported Content Types

*   **Posts:** Single image, single video, or carousel (mixed).
*   **Reels:** Video only. Must be 9:16.
*   **Stories:** Image or video. Expire after 24 hours.

## Quirks & Gotchas

### Aspect Ratios are Law
Instagram is very strict here. 
*   **Stories/Reels:** Must be **9:16** (vertical).
*   **Feed Posts:** Generally **4:5** (vertical) or **1:1** (square).

<Warning>
**Don't try to cheat.** If you upload a 16:9 (landscape) video as a Reel, it might technically "work" but it will look terrible (awkwardly cropped) or be rejected entirely. Your marketing team will not be happy.
</Warning>

### Stories vs. Reels vs. Posts
*   **Stories** are ephemeral. They disappear.
*   **Reels** are for growth. They are public videos.
*   **Posts** are for your feed grid.
