Google Business Profile (formerly Google My Business) lets you post updates that appear in Google Search and Maps.

## Quirks & Gotchas

### Location Selection Required
After connecting your Google account, you must select a business location. This is similar to selecting a Facebook Page or LinkedIn Company Page.

### Post Types
Google Business supports different post types via the `topicType` field:
*   `STANDARD`: Regular updates (default).
*   `EVENT`: Time-bound events with a title and date range.
*   `OFFER`: Promotional offers with coupon codes and terms.
*   `ALERT`: Special alerts (currently only `COVID_19`).

### Call to Action
You can add a CTA button to your posts:
*   `BOOK`, `ORDER`, `SHOP`, `LEARN_MORE`, `SIGN_UP`, `CALL`
*   Requires a `callToActionUrl` for most types.

### Character Limit
Posts are limited to **1,500 characters**.
