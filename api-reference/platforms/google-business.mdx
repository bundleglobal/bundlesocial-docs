Google Business Profile (formerly Google My Business) lets you post updates that appear in Google Search and Maps. It's not social media in the traditional sense, but it's great for local businesses.

## Supported Content Types

*   **Standard Posts:** Regular text updates with optional image.
*   **Events:** Time-bound events with a title and date range.
*   **Offers:** Promotional offers with coupon codes and terms.
*   **Alerts:** Special alerts (currently only `COVID_19`).

## Quirks & Gotchas

### Location Selection Required
After connecting your Google account, you must select a business location. This is similar to selecting a Facebook Page or LinkedIn Company Page.

### Post Types
Google Business supports different post types via the `topicType` field:
*   `STANDARD`: Regular updates (default).
*   `EVENT`: Time-bound events with a title and date range.
*   `OFFER`: Promotional offers with coupon codes and terms.
*   `ALERT`: Special alerts (currently only `COVID_19`).

### Call to Action
You can add a CTA button to your posts:
*   `BOOK`, `ORDER`, `SHOP`, `LEARN_MORE`, `SIGN_UP`, `CALL`
*   Requires a `callToActionUrl` for most types.
