Bluesky is the new decentralized challenger, built on the AT Protocol. It's growing fast but the API is still maturing when it comes to analytics.

## Supported Content Types

*   **Posts:** Text with optional media. Up to 4 files.
*   **Text limit:** 300 characters.

## Quirks & Gotchas

### "Calculated" Impressions
Bluesky does not provide a native "Impression" or "View" count for posts via API.
*   **Our Solution:** We calculate `impressions` as the sum of engagement (Likes + Replies + Reposts + Quotes).
*   **Reality:** The actual number of people who saw it is likely much higher, but we can't prove it. Think of it as a minimum engagement indicator, not true impressions.

### Limited But Growing
Bluesky's API is young. As the platform and protocol mature, we expect more analytics data to become available. We'll add it when it does.

### Media Limits

| Constraint | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Files | 0-4 (images and/or videos) |
| Text | 300 characters |

Bluesky has minimal media restrictions compared to other platforms. See [Platform Limits](/api-reference/limits#bluesky) for details.

## Analytics

For general analytics concepts (refresh rates, data retention, what "Returns 0" means), see the [Analytics Overview](/api-reference/analytics).

### Profile Analytics
**Period:** Snapshot.

| Metric | Description | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `impressions` | - | Returns `0` (not available) |
| `impressionsUnique` | - | Returns `0` (not available) |
| `views` | - | Returns `0` (not available) |
| `viewsUnique` | - | Returns `0` (not available) |
| `likes` | - | Returns `0` (not available at profile level) |
| `comments` | - | Returns `0` (not available at profile level) |
| `postCount` | Total posts | |
| `followers` | Followers | |
| `following` | Following | |

### Post Analytics
**Period:** Lifetime.

| Metric | Description | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `impressions` | Engagement Sum | Calculated: Likes + Replies + Reposts + Quotes |
| `impressionsUnique` | - | Returns `0` (not provided) |
| `views` | - | Same as impressions (calculated) |
| `viewsUnique` | - | Returns `0` (not provided) |
| `likes` | Likes | |
| `comments` | Replies | |
| `shares` | Reposts + Quotes | Combined |
| `saves` | - | Returns `0` (not available) |

### Quirks
- No true impression or view metrics. We derive impressions from total engagement - it's the best we can do.
- Profile-level engagement is not available. Only follower/following counts and post count.
- As Bluesky's API evolves, we'll add new metrics as they become available.
