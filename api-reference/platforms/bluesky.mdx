Bluesky is the new decentralized challenger.

## Quirks & Gotchas

### "Calculated" Impressions
Bluesky does not provide a native "Impression" or "View" count for posts via API.
*   **Our Solution:** We calculate `Impressions` as the sum of engagement (Likes + Replies + Reposts + Quotes).
*   **Reality:** The actual number of people who saw it is likely much higher, but we can't prove it.
