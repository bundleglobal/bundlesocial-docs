TikTok is the place for short-form video. The API is powerful but comes with some specific restrictions around music and privacy.

## Quirks & Gotchas

### Privacy Levels & Permalinks
If you set a video's privacy to `SELF_ONLY` (Private), the API **cannot** return a public permalink immediately.
*   The `permalink` field will be null or internal-only.
*   We can't give you a link to something that doesn't publicly exist.

### Music & Copyright
TikTok is extremely strict about music rights.
*   **Trending Audio:** You generally **cannot** use TikTok's "trending audio" library directly via API.
*   **Royalty-Free:** You can use the `auto_add_music` flag to let TikTok assign royalty-free music, but you lose control over the specific track.
*   **Best Practice:** Burn your audio into the video file before uploading.

### Image Format (Photo Mode)
TikTok only accepts **JPG** and **JPEG** files for Photo Mode posts. PNG and other formats will be rejected.
