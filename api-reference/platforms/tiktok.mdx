TikTok is the place for short-form video. The API is powerful but comes with specific restrictions around music, privacy, and image formats that will surprise you.

## Supported Content Types

*   **Videos:** 1 video, up to 10 minutes. The bread and butter.
*   **Photo Mode (Images):** 1-10 images. **JPG/JPEG only.** If you're thinking "surely PNG works too" - it doesn't.

## Quirks & Gotchas

### Privacy Levels & Permalinks
If you set a video's privacy to `SELF_ONLY` (Private), the API **cannot** return a public permalink immediately.
*   The `permalink` field will be null or internal-only.
*   We can't give you a link to something that doesn't publicly exist. Physics still applies.

### Music & Copyright
TikTok is extremely strict about music rights.
*   **Commercial Music Library (CML):** We expose TikTok's pre-cleared music via [TikTok Music](/api-reference/platforms/tiktok-music) – trending tracks, genres, `song_clip_id` for publish. No copyright roulette.
*   **Trending Audio:** You generally **cannot** use TikTok's in-app "trending audio" library directly via API.
*   **Royalty-Free:** You can use the `autoAddMusic` flag to let TikTok assign royalty-free music, but you lose control over the specific track. It's a gamble.
*   **Best Practice:** Use CML for controlled music, or burn your audio into the video file before uploading.

### Image Format (Photo Mode)
TikTok only accepts **JPG** and **JPEG** files for Photo Mode posts. PNG, WebP, and everything else will be rejected. Convert before uploading.

### The REVIEW Status
TikTok is the most common platform to put posts into a `REVIEW` status. This means TikTok wants to review the content before publishing. We periodically re-check and re-attempt publishing. Tell your users to be patient.

### Media Limits

## Analytics

For general analytics concepts (refresh rates, data retention, what "Returns 0" means), see the [Analytics Overview](/api-reference/analytics).

TikTok provides some of the richest analytics data among all platforms. Demographics, audience splits, the works. Check the raw analytics for the detailed breakdowns.

### Profile Analytics
**Period:** Rolling window (30 days). Aggregated from daily metrics.

| Metric | Description | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `impressions` | Video views | |
| `impressionsUnique` | Unique video views | |
| `views` | Video views | Same as impressions for TikTok |
| `viewsUnique` | Unique video views | Same as impressionsUnique |
| `likes` | Total likes | Aggregated across all videos |
| `comments` | Total comments | |
| `postCount` | Total videos | |
| `followers` | Followers | |
| `following` | Following | |

### Post Analytics
**Period:** Lifetime (Snapshot).

| Metric | Description | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `impressions` | Video views | |
| `impressionsUnique` | Unique views | TikTok doesn't always distinguish; can equal impressions |
| `views` | Video views | Same as impressions |
| `viewsUnique` | Unique views | Same as impressionsUnique |
| `likes` | Likes | |
| `comments` | Comments | |
| `shares` | Shares | |
| `saves` | - | Returns `0` (not provided by TikTok API) |

### Quirks
- Profile analytics aggregate daily metrics over a 30-day window.
- Post analytics are lifetime values.
- TikTok can take up to **48 hours** to process some detailed analytics like audience demographics.
- Views and unique views are tracked separately but can sometimes be 0 if the platform decides so.
