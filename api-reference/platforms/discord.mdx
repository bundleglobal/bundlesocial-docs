Discord works differently from other platforms. Instead of OAuth tokens, we use **webhooks** that you set up in your Discord server.

## Quirks & Gotchas

### Webhook-Based Posting
Discord doesn't allow third-party apps to post as a user. Instead, we use webhooks.
*   You connect a Discord server and select which channels to enable.
*   We create a webhook for each channel.
*   Posts appear as a "bot" message with a customizable username and avatar.

### Channel Selection Required
Unlike other platforms, you must specify a `channelId` in your post data. You can find available channels in the `socialAccount.channels` array.

### Custom Bot Identity
You can customize how your posts appear:
*   `username`: Up to 80 characters. This is the name shown as the message author.
*   `avatarUrl`: A URL to an image that will be used as the bot's avatar.

  socialAccountTypes: ["DISCORD"],
  data: {
    DISCORD: {

      text: "Hello from bundle.social!",
