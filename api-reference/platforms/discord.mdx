Discord works differently from other platforms. Instead of OAuth tokens, we use **webhooks** that you set up in your Discord server.

## Quirks & Gotchas

### Webhook-Based Posting
Discord doesn't allow third-party apps to post as a user. Instead, we use webhooks.
*   You connect a Discord server and select which channels to enable.
*   We create a webhook for each channel.
*   Posts appear as a "bot" message with a customizable username and avatar.

### Channel Selection Required
Unlike other platforms, you must specify a `channelId` in your post data. You can find available channels in the `socialAccount.channels` array.

### Custom Bot Identity
You can customize how your posts appear:
*   `username`: Up to 80 characters. This is the name shown as the message author.
*   `avatarUrl`: A URL to an image that will be used as the bot's avatar.

## Analytics

For general analytics concepts, see the [Analytics Overview](/api-reference/analytics).

Discord does not provide analytics via its API. All metrics return `0`. It's a messaging platform, not an analytics platform.

| Metric | Note |
| :--- | :--- |
| `impressions` | Returns `0` |
| `views` | Returns `0` |
| `likes` | Returns `0` |
| `comments` | Returns `0` |

## Example

```javascript
await bundle.post.create({
  socialAccountTypes: ["DISCORD"],
  data: {
    DISCORD: {
      channelId: "123456789012345678",
      text: "Hello from bundle.social!",
      username: "My Bot",
      avatarUrl: "https://example.com/avatar.png"
    }
  }
});
```
