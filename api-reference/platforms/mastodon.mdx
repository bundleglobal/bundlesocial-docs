Mastodon is part of the Fediverse. It's decentralized, which means "analytics" is a loose concept. Each instance runs independently, and there's no central authority tracking impressions or views.

## Supported Content Types

*   **Toots (Posts):** Text with optional media. Up to 4 files.
*   Mixed images and videos allowed, but only 1 video max.

## Quirks & Gotchas

### Terminology
*   **Likes** = **Favourites** (British spelling, because Mastodon).
*   **Shares** = **Reblogs** (like retweets, but federated).
*   **Posts** = **Toots** (or "statuses" in the API, because naming things is hard).

### Character Limits
Character limits are **instance-dependent** - most instances default to 500, but some allow more. We can't know in advance what your user's instance allows.

## Analytics

For general analytics concepts (refresh rates, data retention, what "Returns 0" means), see the [Analytics Overview](/api-reference/analytics).

Mastodon has very limited analytics capabilities. Being decentralized means there's no central tracking of impressions or views.

### Profile Analytics
**Period:** Snapshot.

| Metric | Description | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `impressions` | - | Returns `0` (not available) |
| `impressionsUnique` | - | Returns `0` (not available) |
| `views` | - | Returns `0` (not available) |
| `viewsUnique` | - | Returns `0` (not available) |
| `likes` | - | Returns `0` (not available at profile level) |
| `comments` | - | Returns `0` (not available at profile level) |
| `postCount` | Total toots | |
| `followers` | Followers | |
| `following` | Following | |

### Post Analytics
**Period:** Lifetime.

| Metric | Description | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `impressions` | - | Returns `0` (not available) |
| `impressionsUnique` | - | Returns `0` (not available) |
| `views` | - | Returns `0` (not available) |
| `viewsUnique` | - | Returns `0` (not available) |
| `likes` | Favourites | |
| `comments` | Replies | |
| `shares` | Reblogs | |
| `saves` | - | Returns `0` (not available) |

### Quirks
- No impression or view metrics. The Fediverse doesn't track eyeballs the way corporate social media does.
- Only basic engagement metrics (favourites, replies, reblogs) are available per post.
- Profile-level engagement is not aggregated by Mastodon's API.
- This is by design, not a bug. Privacy-focused platform = limited tracking.
