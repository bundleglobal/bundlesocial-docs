Google Business reviews are handled through an async import flow. You queue an import, poll status, then work with normalized review records in our API.

## How it works

This is an **asynchronous** job, same idea as Post History Import:
1.  **Start:** Trigger an import ("Fetch 50 reviews for this location").
2.  **Wait:** We fetch from Google and process the batch.
3.  **Poll:** Check import status.
4.  **Fetch:** Read imported reviews from the reviews endpoint.
5.  **Reply:** Create/update/delete owner replies.

## Step 1: Start the Import

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/misc/google-business/reviews/import`

```json
{
  "teamId": "team_123",
  "count": 50
}
```

### Rules & Limits

*   **`count` range:** `1-100` per request.
*   **One active import per social account:** if one is already running, you'll get `409`.
*   **Monthly limit per social account (default):**
    *   **Free:** 5 reviews / month
    *   **Pro:** 100 reviews / month
    *   **Business:** 250 reviews / month

<Note>
These are defaults. Organizations can have custom review-import limits configured.
</Note>

<Important>
You need a connected Google Business social account with a selected location. No location = no review import.
</Important>

## Step 2: Check Import Status

**Endpoints:**
*   `GET /api/v1/misc/google-business/reviews/import?teamId=team_123`
*   `GET /api/v1/misc/google-business/reviews/import/:importId`

The list endpoint returns up to 20 latest imports for that team/location, newest first.

### Statuses

*   `PENDING`: Waiting in queue.
*   `FETCHING_REVIEWS`: Import is running.
*   `COMPLETED`: Finished.
*   `FAILED`: Import failed after retries.
*   `RATE_LIMITED`: Temporarily paused due to API/rate pressure; resumes automatically after `rateLimitResetAt`.

Example import object:

```json
{
  "id": "imp_abc123",
  "teamId": "team_123",
  "socialAccountId": "sa_123",
  "requestedCount": 50,
  "status": "FETCHING_REVIEWS",
  "reviewsImported": 24,
  "error": null,
  "rateLimitResetAt": null,
  "startedAt": "2026-02-17T10:00:00.000Z",
  "completedAt": null,
  "createdAt": "2026-02-17T09:59:55.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-02-17T10:00:08.000Z",
  "deletedAt": null
}
```

## Step 3: Fetch Imported Reviews

**Endpoints:**
*   `GET /api/v1/misc/google-business/reviews?teamId=team_123&limit=50&offset=0`
*   `GET /api/v1/misc/google-business/reviews/:reviewId?teamId=team_123`

### Query Parameters (`GET /reviews`)

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `teamId` | string | required | Team ID |
| `limit` | number | `50` | Page size (`1-100`) |
| `offset` | number | `0` | Pagination offset |

Example response:

```json
{
  "reviews": [
    {
      "id": "rev_123",
      "socialAccountId": "sa_123",
      "teamId": "team_123",
      "externalReviewId": "accounts/123/locations/456/reviews/789",
      "reviewerDisplayName": "Jane Doe",
      "reviewerProfilePhotoUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/...",
      "starRating": "FIVE",
      "comment": "Amazing service, will come back!",
      "reviewReplyComment": "Thanks a lot for your feedback!",
      "reviewReplyUpdatedAt": "2026-02-17T12:15:00.000Z",
      "createTime": "2026-02-16T18:22:00.000Z",
      "updateTime": "2026-02-17T12:15:00.000Z",
      "importedAt": "2026-02-17T12:15:02.000Z",
      "createdAt": "2026-02-17T12:15:02.000Z",
      "updatedAt": "2026-02-17T12:15:02.000Z",
      "deletedAt": null
    }
  ],
  "total": 1,
  "limit": 100,
  "remainingCapacity": 99
}
```

`starRating` values: `ONE`, `TWO`, `THREE`, `FOUR`, `FIVE`.

`limit` in this response is your monthly import cap for that social account (not the page size).

## Step 4: Reply to Reviews

### Create or Update Reply

**Endpoint:** `PUT /api/v1/misc/google-business/reviews/:reviewId/reply`

```json
{
  "teamId": "team_123",
  "comment": "Thank you for visiting us!"
}
```

`comment` length: `1-4096` chars.

### Delete Reply

**Endpoint:** `DELETE /api/v1/misc/google-business/reviews/:reviewId/reply`

```json
{
  "teamId": "team_123"
}
```

Both endpoints return the updated review object.

## Quirks & Gotchas

### Incremental Sync (No Duplicate Spam)
Re-running imports is safe. Reviews are upserted by external review ID, so existing reviews are updated instead of duplicated.

### Overlap Window for Edits
Imports intentionally overlap recent data to catch delayed edits/reply updates from Google. So yes, some recently imported reviews may be re-processed - that's expected.

### Temporary `RATE_LIMITED` Is Normal
When Google slows things down, imports switch to `RATE_LIMITED` and auto-resume. No manual retry endpoint needed for this path.

### Capacity Is Per Social Account
`remainingCapacity` is calculated per connected Google Business social account, not globally across all accounts.
