Reddit is a collection of communities, each with its own rules. The API is functional but stingy with data - especially analytics.

## Supported Content Types

*   **Text Posts:** Title + text. Title is required.
*   **Link Posts:** Title + URL.
*   **Image Posts:** 1 image, or gallery (up to 10 images if the subreddit allows).
*   **Video Posts:** 1 video.

## Quirks & Gotchas

### Subreddit Rules are King
Each subreddit has its own rules about what's allowed:
*   Some subreddits don't allow media at all.
*   Some allow images but not galleries.
*   Some require flairs.
*   We validate against subreddit settings before posting. If it's not allowed, you get a clear error.

### Engagement Terminology
*   **Likes** = **Upvotes**
*   **Dislikes** = **Downvotes**
*   **Shares** = **Crossposts**

Reddit does not track "Impressions" or "Reach" the way marketers want. If that's a dealbreaker, you're on the wrong platform.

### Media Limits

## Analytics

For general analytics concepts (refresh rates, data retention, what "Returns 0" means), see the [Analytics Overview](/api-reference/analytics).

### Profile Analytics
**Status:** Not available.

Reddit does not provide profile-level analytics through their API. Everything returns `0`. All of it. Every single metric. Don't ask.

### Post Analytics
**Period:** Lifetime.

| Metric | Description | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `impressions` | - | Returns `0` (not available) |
| `impressionsUnique` | - | Returns `0` (not available) |
| `views` | View count | May not be available for all posts |
| `viewsUnique` | - | Returns `0` (not available) |
| `likes` | Upvotes | |
| `dislikes` | Downvotes | |
| `comments` | Comments | |
| `shares` | Crossposts | |
| `saves` | - | Returns `0` (not available) |

### Quirks
- Reddit has the most limited analytics of any major platform we support.
- No profile-level analytics whatsoever.
- View counts exist for some posts but are not guaranteed.
- No impressions or reach metrics. Reddit's API simply doesn't provide them.
- Upvotes/downvotes are the primary engagement signals.
