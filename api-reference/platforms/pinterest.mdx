Pinterest is about discovery, not just a feed. People come here to find ideas and save them for later. The API reflects this - "saves" are the key metric, not likes.

## Supported Content Types

*   **Pins:** 1 image or 1 video. That's it - one file per pin.

## Quirks & Gotchas

### Board ID is Required
You can't pin to thin air. Every Pinterest post needs a `boardId`. Get available boards from the social account data.

### Terminology
*   **Likes** are often referred to as **Saves** or **Reactions** depending on context. We normalize them in our schema.
*   **Video Pins:** Only video pins have true "View" counts. Static image pins just show impressions in the views field.

### Media Limits

## Analytics

For general analytics concepts (refresh rates, data retention, what "Returns 0" means), see the [Analytics Overview](/api-reference/analytics).

### Profile Analytics
**Period:** Rolling window (30 days). Aggregated across all pin analytics.

| Metric | Description | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `impressions` | Total impressions | |
| `impressionsUnique` | - | Same as impressions (Pinterest doesn't distinguish) |
| `views` | Video views | Defaults to impressions if no video pins |
| `viewsUnique` | - | Same as views |
| `likes` | Saves | |
| `comments` | - | Returns `0` (not provided at profile level) |
| `postCount` | Total pins | |
| `followers` | Followers | |
| `following` | Following | |

### Post Analytics
**Period:** Mixed (30-day rolling window for views/impressions, Lifetime for engagement).

| Metric | Description | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `impressions` | Impressions | 30-day window |
| `impressionsUnique` | - | Same as impressions |
| `views` | Video views | 30-day window; defaults to impressions for static pins |
| `viewsUnique` | - | Same as views |
| `likes` | Total reactions | Lifetime |
| `comments` | Total comments | Lifetime |
| `shares` | - | Returns `0` (not tracked by Pinterest) |
| `saves` | Saves | 30-day window |

### Quirks
- Views are only meaningful for video pins. Static pins show impressions in the views field as a fallback.
- Profile-level comments are not available through the Pinterest API.
- Shares are not a concept Pinterest tracks.
- Post analytics use a mixed approach: some metrics are rolling window, others are lifetime. It's confusing, but it's what Pinterest gives us.
