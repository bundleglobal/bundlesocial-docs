## Overview

You have two ways to upload files. 
1.  **Simple Upload:** Quick, easy, for small stuff.
2.  **Resumable Upload:** Robust, 3-step process, for big videos.

<Warning>
**Recommendation:** Always use the **Resumable Upload** for videos. It's more reliable. If a 1GB upload fails at 99% with the Simple method, you start over. With Resumable, you don't.

## Method 1: Resumable Upload (The Pro Way)

Ideal for videos or anything >25MB.

### Step 1: Initialize
Tell us what you're planning to upload.

**Endpoint:** `POST /upload/init`

```json
// Request
{
  "fileName": "viral-video.mp4",
  "mimeType": "video/mp4",
  "teamId": "..." // optional
}
```

**Response:**
We give you a magic `url` (Pre-signed URL) and a `path`. Keep them safe.

```json
{
  "url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/...",
  "path": "uploads/123/viral-video.mp4"
}
```

### Step 2: Push the Bytes
Send the raw binary file to the `url` we gave you. Use `PUT`.

<Note>
**Important:** Do not wrap this in JSON or Multipart form. Just send the raw bytes.
</Note>

```bash
curl -X PUT "https://storage.googleapis.com/..." \
  --upload-file ./viral-video.mp4
```

### Step 3: Finalize
Tell us you're done so we can register the file in our system.

**Endpoint:** `POST /upload/finalize`

```json
// Request
{
  "path": "uploads/123/viral-video.mp4", // from Step 1
  "teamId": "..."
}
```

**Response:**
You get an `id` (e.g., `upload_abc123`). **This is the ID you use when creating a post.**

## Method 2: Simple Upload (The Lazy Way)

Good for images or small clips. Uses standard `multipart/form-data`.

**Endpoint:** `POST /upload/create`

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.bundle.social/upload/create" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY" \
  -F "file=@./meme.jpg" \
  -F "teamId=YOUR_TEAM_ID"
```

**Response:**
Returns the `id` immediately.

**Tip:** If you are uploading a picture of your cat (or your mom, we don't judge), Simple Upload is fine. For a 4K podcast clip, use Resumable.
