## Overview

You have two ways to upload files. 
1.  **Simple Upload:** Quick, easy, for small stuff.
2.  **Resumable Upload:** Robust, 3-step process, for big videos.

<Warning>
**Recommendation:** Always use the **Resumable Upload** for videos. It's more reliable. If a 1GB upload fails at 99% with the Simple method, you start over. With Resumable, you don't.
</Warning>

## Method 1: Resumable Upload (The Pro Way)

Ideal for videos or anything >25MB.

### Step 1: Initialize
Tell us what you're planning to upload.

**Endpoint:** `POST /upload/init`

```json
// Request
{
  "fileName": "viral-video.mp4",
  "mimeType": "video/mp4",
  "teamId": "..." // optional
}
```

**Response:**
We give you a magic `url` (Pre-signed URL) and a `path`. Keep them safe.

```json
{
  "url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/...",
  "path": "uploads/123/viral-video.mp4"
}
```

<Note>
**The pre-signed URL expires after 10 minutes.** If you don't start uploading within that window, you'll need to initialize again. Don't go make coffee between Step 1 and Step 2.
</Note>

### Step 2: Push the Bytes
Send the raw binary file to the `url` we gave you. Use `PUT`.

<Note>
**Important:** Do not wrap this in JSON or Multipart form. Just send the raw bytes.
</Note>

```bash
curl -X PUT "https://storage.googleapis.com/..." \
  --upload-file ./viral-video.mp4
```

### Step 3: Finalize
Tell us you're done so we can register the file in our system.

**Endpoint:** `POST /upload/finalize`

```json
// Request
{
  "path": "uploads/123/viral-video.mp4", // from Step 1
  "teamId": "..."
}
```

**Response:**
You get an `id` (e.g., `upload_abc123`). **This is the ID you use when creating a post.**

## Method 2: Simple Upload (The Lazy Way)

Good for images or small clips. Uses standard `multipart/form-data`.

**Endpoint:** `POST /upload/create`

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.bundle.social/upload/create" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_KEY" \
  -F "file=@./meme.jpg" \
  -F "teamId=YOUR_TEAM_ID"
```

**Response:**
Returns the `id` immediately.

## Supported Formats & Limits

| Type | Formats | Max Size |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Images** | JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP | 25 MB |
| **Videos** | MP4 | Platform-dependent (see [Limits](/api-reference/limits)) |

<Note>
The max video size depends on the platform you're posting to. TikTok allows up to 4 GB, YouTube up to 256 GB, while Discord caps at 25 MB. Check [Platform Limits](/api-reference/limits) for the exact numbers per platform.
</Note>

<Info>
**Tip:** If you are uploading a picture of your cat (or your mom, we don't judge), Simple Upload is fine. For a 4K podcast clip, use Resumable.

## Video Compression

You can enable automatic video compression on your organization. When enabled, we'll compress videos larger than 10 MB before they're stored and posted.

### How to enable

Video compression is an organization-level setting. You can toggle it from your dashboard or contact us to enable it. Once on, it applies to all uploads across all teams in your org.

### What happens

| Setting | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Threshold | Videos > 10 MB |
| Output format | MP4 (H.264 + AAC) |
| Quality | CRF 30 (good balance of quality and size) |
| Preset | Medium |

We're smart about it - if the compressed file ends up **larger** than the original (rare, but it happens with already-compressed videos), we keep the original and toss the compressed version. You always get the smaller file.

<Tip>
This is great if your users upload raw or minimally compressed videos. A 500 MB screen recording can often shrink to under 100 MB with no visible quality loss. Your storage costs will thank you - and so will the upload speeds.
