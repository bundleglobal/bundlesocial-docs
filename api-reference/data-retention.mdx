We don't keep your data forever. Storage costs money, and we are great on your wallet - don't exploit us. We are not running a digital museum. Here's exactly what gets cleaned up, when, and why.

## Analytics Data - 40 Days

**What:** All parsed and raw analytics data (profile analytics, post analytics, and their raw counterparts).

**Retention:** **40 days** from the date the analytics record was created.

After 40 days, the data is gone. Permanently. No backups. No "can you please recover it?". No.

### What You Should Do

If you need analytics history beyond 40 days (and you probably do if you're building dashboards or reports), set up a daily sync. Here's a battle-tested approach:

```typescript
// analytics-sync.ts - Run this daily via cron
import { CronJob } from 'cron';

const syncAnalytics = async () => {
  // 1. Fetch all teams
  const teams = await yourDatabase.teams.findAll();

  for (const team of teams) {
    // 2. For each social account, fetch current analytics
    for (const account of team.socialAccounts) {
      const analytics = await bundlesocial.analytics.getSocialAccountAnalytics({
        teamId: team.id,
        socialAccountId: account.id,
      });

      // 3. Store with timestamp for historical tracking
      await yourDatabase.analyticsHistory.upsert({
        socialAccountId: account.id,
        date: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0], // YYYY-MM-DD
        ...analytics,
        fetchedAt: new Date(),
      });
    }

    // 4. Fetch post analytics too
    const posts = await bundlesocial.analytics.getBulkPostAnalytics({
      teamId: team.id,
    });

    for (const post of posts.data) {
      await yourDatabase.postAnalyticsHistory.upsert({
        postId: post.id,
        date: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0],
        ...post.analytics,
        fetchedAt: new Date(),
      });
    }
  }
};

// Run daily at 2 AM UTC
new CronJob('0 2 * * *', syncAnalytics, null, true, 'UTC');
```

With this running, you have full analytics history in your own database. Build dashboards, generate reports, impress clients - all without worrying about our 40-day window.

<Note>
**Why 40 days?** Because it covers a full rolling window (30 days) plus a 10-day buffer. If we kept data for 30 days, you'd lose the beginning of your rolling window before you could fetch it. We're evil, but not that evil.

## Webhook Events - 7 Days

**What:** All webhook event records (delivery attempts, payloads, responses).

**Retention:** **7 days** from the date the event was created.

If you need to debug a webhook delivery from last week, you have 7 days. After that, the record is gone.

### What You Should Do

Log webhook payloads on your end when you receive them. This is standard practice for any webhook integration. If you're not logging incoming webhooks, you're living dangerously.

---

## Deleted Uploads - 7 Days

**What:** Files you've deleted (images, videos) and their database records.

**Retention:** **7 days** after you soft-delete an upload.

When you delete an upload, we don't immediately nuke the file. We keep it around for 7 days in case you change your mind (or in case it's still referenced by active posts). After 7 days:

- If the upload is used by active posts: We remove the file from storage but keep the database record (so post references don't break).
- If the upload is unused: Both the file and the database record are deleted.

---

## Imported Posts - 30 Days

**What:** Posts imported via the [Post History Import](/api-reference/import-posts) feature.

**Retention:** **30 days** from the date of import.

Imported posts are meant to populate your dashboard quickly - not to serve as a permanent archive. After 30 days, they're deleted (along with their analytics, via cascade).

### Monthly Import Counter Reset

Your import quota resets on the **1st of every month**. So if you hit your monthly limit, just wait for the calendar to flip.

## Summary

| Data Type | Retention Period |
| :--- | :--- |
| Analytics (parsed + raw) | **40 days** |
| Webhook events | **7 days** |
| Deleted uploads | **7 days** after deletion |
| Imported posts | **30 days** |

## The Golden Rule

**If you need it long-term, store it yourself.**

We are optimized for real-time publishing and recent analytics. We are not Snowflake. We are not BigQuery. We are a social media API that happens to collect analytics as a side quest.

Set up a daily sync. It takes 20 minutes to build (we gave you the code above). You'll sleep better.
