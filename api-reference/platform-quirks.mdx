title: Platform Quirks & Gotchas
description: Specific limitations and behaviors for each supported platform.
---

While bundle.social unifies social media APIs, each platform has its own unique behaviors and limitations. This guide highlights the most common "gotchas" developers encounter.

---

## LinkedIn

### Personal vs. Organization Accounts
LinkedIn distinguishes between **Member** (Personal Profile) and **Organization** (Company Page) accounts.

*   **Post History Import:** Only supported for **Organization** accounts. You cannot import past posts from a Personal Profile due to API limitations.
*   **Analytics:** Detailed analytics are richer for Organization pages.

### Mentions
To mention a user or company in a post, you cannot just use `@username`. You must use the specific URN format if you are constructing raw text, though our API handles basic text automatically.
*   **Organizations:** `urn:li:organization:12345`
*   **People:** `urn:li:person:abcde`

## TikTok

### Privacy Levels & Permalinks
If you set a video's privacy level to `SELF_ONLY` (Private), the API **cannot** return a public permalink (share URL) immediately. The `permalink` field in the response may be null or internal-only until the video is made public.

### Music & Copyright
TikTok is strict about music copyright.
*   Videos uploaded via API cannot utilize TikTok's "trending audio" library directly.
*   The `auto_add_music` flag allows TikTok to assign royalty-free music, but you have less control over the specific track.

## Instagram

### Stories vs. Reels vs. Posts
*   **Stories:** Can be **Images** or **Videos**. They expire after 24 hours.
*   **Reels:** Must be **Videos**.
*   **Posts:** Can be Images, Videos, or Carousels (mixed).

### Aspect Ratios are Strict
Instagram will reject media that doesn't fit specific ratios:
*   **Stories/Reels:** Must be **9:16** (vertical).
*   **Feed Posts:** Generally **4:5** (vertical) or **1:1** (square).
*   If you upload a 16:9 (landscape) video as a Reel, it may be rejected or cropped awkwardly.

## YouTube

### "Made for Kids"
You must flag content as `madeForKids: true` if it targets children. Failure to do so can result in penalties from YouTube. This field is available in the `data.YOUTUBE` object when creating a post.

### Shorts
Any video less than 60 seconds with a vertical aspect ratio (9:16) or square (1:1) is automatically considered a **Short** by YouTube. You don't need to specify a special "type", but you must ensure the file meets these criteria.

## Facebook

### Page Tokens Expire
Facebook Page Access Tokens typically expire after **60 days**. Your users will need to reconnect their account periodically. We handle the token refresh automatically where possible, but if a user changes their password or security settings, the token will be invalidated immediately.

### Reels Limitations
Facebook Reels via API have stricter limitations than mobile uploads.
*   No "Remix" functionality.

## General

### Rate Limits
We handle rate limiting for you by queuing posts. However, if you blast 100 posts at once for a single social account, they will be processed sequentially to respect platform limits.
