Webhooks are how you know if a post actually went live or if it exploded. Instead of polling us every 2 seconds like a psychopath, just give us a URL and we'll tell you.

<Note>
**Prerequisite:** You need an API Key and a URL where we can send POST requests. Webhooks are configured at the **organization** level - all teams under that org share the same webhook endpoints.
</Note>

## Setup

1.  Go to the [Webhooks Dashboard](https://bundle.social/dashboard/organization/webhooks).
2.  Add your URL (e.g., `https://api.yourapp.com/webhooks/bundle`). Must be **HTTPS**.
3.  Get your **Signing Secret**.

<Tip>
**Local Dev:** Use `ngrok` to test locally. `ngrok http 3000`.

## Events

| Event | When it fires |
| :--- | :--- |
| `post.published` | Post went live (or failed permanently after retries) |
| `post.failed` | Post failed - check the error details |
| `comment.published` | First comment was posted (or failed permanently) |
| `social-account.created` | User connected a new social account |
| `social-account.deleted` | Social account was disconnected |
| `team.created` | A new team was created |
| `team.updated` | Team details changed (name, avatar, social accounts added/removed) |
| `team.deleted` | A team was deleted |

<Note>
`team.updated` also fires when a social account is added to or removed from a team - so you don't need to listen to social account events separately if you're already tracking teams.
</Note>

## Payload Structure

Every webhook delivery is an HTTP POST with this shape:

```json
{
  "type": "post.published",
  "data": {
    // ... event-specific payload
  }
}
```

### Headers We Send

| Header | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` |
| `User-Agent` | `bundlesocial` |
| `x-signature` | HMAC-SHA256 signature (see [Security](#security-verify-its-us)) |

### Post Events Payload

When you receive `post.published` or `post.failed`, the `data` field contains the full post object:

```json
{
  "type": "post.published",
  "data": {
    "id": "post_abc123",
    "title": "My awesome post",
    "content": "Hello world!",
    "status": "POSTED",
    "scheduledDate": "2026-01-15T10:00:00.000Z",
    "postedDate": "2026-01-15T10:00:02.341Z",
    "teamId": "team_xyz",
    "createdAt": "2026-01-14T15:30:00.000Z",
    "updatedAt": "2026-01-15T10:00:02.341Z",
    "deletedAt": null,
    "uploads": [
      {
        "upload": {
          "id": "upload_456",
          "fileName": "cover.jpg",
          "mimeType": "image/jpeg",
          "size": 245000
        }
      }
    ],
    "socialAccounts": [
      {
        "socialAccount": {
          "id": "sa_789",
          "type": "INSTAGRAM",
          "username": "mybrand",
          "displayName": "My Brand"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Comment Events Payload

```json
{
  "type": "comment.published",
  "data": {
    "id": "comment_abc",
    "content": "#growth #mindset",
    "status": "POSTED",
    "postId": "post_abc123",
    "teamId": "team_xyz",
    "createdAt": "2026-01-15T10:00:05.000Z",
    "socialAccounts": [
      {
        "socialAccount": {
          "id": "sa_789",
          "type": "INSTAGRAM",
          "username": "mybrand"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Social Account Events Payload

```json
{
  "type": "social-account.created",
  "data": {
    "id": "sa_789",
    "type": "INSTAGRAM",
    "teamId": "team_xyz",
    "username": "mybrand",
    "displayName": "My Brand",
    "avatarUrl": "https://...",
    "externalId": "17841400000",
    "channels": [],
    "createdAt": "2026-01-10T12:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

Sensitive fields like `accessToken`, `refreshToken`, `secret`, and `expiresAt` are **never** included in webhook payloads. We're not that reckless.

### Team Events Payload

```json
{
  "type": "team.created",
  "data": {
    "id": "team_xyz",
    "name": "Marketing Team",
    "avatarUrl": "https://...",
    "organizationId": "org_123",
    "createdById": "user_456",
    "createdAt": "2026-01-10T12:00:00.000Z",
    "organization": { "id": "org_123", "name": "Acme Corp" },
    "createdBy": { "id": "user_456", "email": "..." },
    "socialAccounts": []
  }
}
```

## Delivery & Retries

We really try to deliver your webhooks. Here's how hard we try:

| Setting | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Timeout | 15 seconds per request |
| Max attempts | 3 (initial + 2 retries) |
| Backoff | Exponential, starting at 30 seconds |
| Concurrency | We process up to 50 deliveries simultaneously |

So if your server is down, we'll try 3 times with increasing delays. After that, the event is marked as failed and we move on. We're persistent, not obsessive.

### Auto-Disable (The Safety Net)

If your webhook endpoint fails **50 consecutive times** within a **24-hour window**, we automatically disable it. This protects both of us - we stop wasting resources, and you stop missing events you don't know about.

When this happens:
- Your webhook is marked as **disabled**
- We stop sending events to that URL
- You can re-enable it from the dashboard or API (this resets the failure counter)
- On the next successful delivery, the failure counter resets to 0

<Warning>
**Don't let your endpoint go down for too long.** 50 consecutive failures is generous, but if your server is having a bad day, re-enable manually once it's back. Events that happened while disabled are gone - we don't replay them.
</Warning>

### Resending Events

Made a mistake in your handler? Event got lost? You can resend any webhook event from the dashboard or via the API. We'll create a fresh delivery attempt with the same payload.

## Best Practices

1. **Respond fast.** Return a `200` within 15 seconds. Do heavy processing asynchronously. If you take too long, we'll count it as a failure.
2. **Be idempotent.** We might deliver the same event twice in rare cases (retries, race conditions). Use the event ID to deduplicate.
3. **Verify signatures.** Always. No exceptions. Even in development. See the [SDK](/api-reference/sdk) for built-in signature verification, or check the [Swagger](/api-reference/openapi) for the raw details.
4. **Use HTTPS.** We only send webhooks to HTTPS URLs. Sorry, `http://localhost` works via ngrok though.
5. **Monitor your failures.** If you're getting close to 50 consecutive failures, fix your endpoint before we disable it.
