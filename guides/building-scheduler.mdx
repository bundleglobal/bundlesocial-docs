So you want to build a scheduler? You want to be the next Buffer or Hootsuite? 

Here is how you do it with bundle.social.

## The Architecture

1.  **User connects account** (via [Connect Flow](/api-reference/connect-social-accounts)).
2.  **User uploads content** (via [Media Upload](/api-reference/upload-content)).
3.  **User picks a date** (UI).
4.  **You send it to us** (API).
5.  **We publish it** (Magic).
6.  **We ping you back** (Webhooks).

---

## Step 1: Import History (Optional)
Don't show an empty calendar. Import their last 10 posts so they feel at home.
*See [Import Post History](/api-reference/import-posts).*

## Step 2: Upload Media
**Crucial:** Do this *before* the user hits "Schedule".
*   Use **Simple Upload** for images.
*   Use **Resumable Upload** for videos.

Get the `uploadId` (e.g. `upload_123`). You need this.

## Step 3: Create the Post
Here is the payload to schedule a post for the future.

```typescript
const payload = {
  teamId: 'team_abc',
  socialAccountIds: ['instagram_123'],
  text: "Scheduled for the future! 🚀",
  uploadIds: ['upload_123'],
  
  // THE IMPORTANT PART
  scheduledAt: "2026-12-25T10:00:00.000Z", // UTC ISO string
  
  // Platform specifics? We got you.
  data: {
    INSTAGRAM: {
      type: "REEL" // Force it to be a Reel
    }
  },
  
  // First comment for hashtags
  comments: [
    {
      text: "#growth #mindset #grind",
      socialAccountIds: ['instagram_123']
    }
  ]
};
```

<Warning>
**Timezones matter.** Always send `scheduledAt` in **UTC**. If your user is in Tokyo, convert their "10:00 AM" to UTC before sending it to us. If you don't, they will be posting at 3 AM and blaming you.
</Warning>

## Step 4: Listen for Webhooks
Scheduling is async. We might succeed, or Instagram might reject the video encoding at the last second.

Listen for:
*   `post.published`: 🟢 Success. Update your UI to "Published".
*   `post.failed`: 🔴 Failure. Tell the user (and maybe why).

## Best Practices

### 1. Validate First
Don't let a user schedule a 10-minute video for an Instagram Story. It will fail. Check our [Platform Limits](/api-reference/limits) and block it in your UI.

### 2. Handle Rate Limits
If you are building a bulk uploader, respect the rate limits. If you blast 50 posts at once, we might queue them or reject them.

### 3. First Comment Strategy
Use the `comments` array to put hashtags in the first comment. It keeps the caption clean and looks more professional.
