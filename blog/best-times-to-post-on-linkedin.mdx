<h2>Why Timing Matters on LinkedIn</h2>
The feed rewards fresh posts that earn quick engagement. Post during active windows, and your ideas are more likely to reach second degree and third degree networks. Timing is a simple lever that compounds reach over time.

<h2>How to Find Your Best Time</h2>
1. Map your time zones: If your buyers span regions, set two posting windows.
2. Align with your ICP: Execs often check feeds early, operators scan late morning, creators return after lunch.
3. Test two slots per weekday: Keep topics similar to avoid content bias in the experiment.
4. Watch early signals: Impressions, profile views, and comment velocity in the first hour.
5. Schedule consistently: Use bundle.social to schedule posts, compare time windows, and keep momentum.

<h2>Content Tips for LinkedIn</h2>
- Lead with a strong first line that earns the click to expand.
- Use plain language, short paragraphs, and clear outcomes.
- Add a single call to action, not three.
- Build threads or carousels for complex topics, then summarize.
