## Why Timing Matters on LinkedIn
The feed rewards fresh posts that earn quick engagement. Post during active windows, and your ideas are more likely to reach second degree and third degree networks. Timing is a simple lever that compounds reach over time.

## How to Find Your Best Time
1. Map your time zones: If your buyers span regions, set two posting windows.
2. Align with your ICP: Execs often check feeds early, operators scan late morning, creators return after lunch.
3. Test two slots per weekday: Keep topics similar to avoid content bias in the experiment.
4. Watch early signals: Impressions, profile views, and comment velocity in the first hour.
5. Schedule consistently: Use bundle.social to schedule posts, compare time windows, and keep momentum.

## Content Tips for LinkedIn
- Lead with a strong first line that earns the click to expand.
- Use plain language, short paragraphs, and clear outcomes.
- Add a single call to action, not three.
- Build [threads](/api-reference/platforms/threads) or carousels for complex topics, then summarize.
