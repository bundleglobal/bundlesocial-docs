*Just me preparing to snag the best deals at Trader Joe's. The setup is overkill, but so is manually checking five social media dashboards.*

## The Analytics Fragmentation Problem

You manage social media presence across [Instagram](/api-reference/platforms/instagram), [TikTok](/api-reference/platforms/tiktok), [YouTube](/api-reference/platforms/youtube), [LinkedIn](/api-reference/platforms/linkedin), and [Twitter](/api-reference/platforms/twitter). Each platform has its own analytics dashboard. Each defines metrics differently. Each requires separate logins, separate exports, and separate mental models.

Your boss asks a simple question: *"How did we perform last month?"*

You spend the next three hours:
- Logging into five platforms
- Exporting CSVs with different column names
- Trying to reconcile why Instagram calls it "Reach" and LinkedIn calls it "Unique Impressions"
- Building a spreadsheet that's outdated the moment you finish it

This is the reality for most marketing teams. And if you're a developer trying to build analytics into your product, it's even worse - you're dealing with five different APIs, five different authentication flows, and five different data schemas.

A social media analytics API solves this by providing unified access to metrics across platforms through a single interface. But not all analytics APIs are created equal. This guide covers what you need to know - whether you're evaluating tools, building your own dashboard, or trying to understand what's actually possible.

## What Is a Social Media Analytics API?

A social media analytics API is a programmatic interface that lets you pull performance metrics from social media platforms. Instead of manually checking dashboards or exporting CSVs, you make API calls and receive structured data.

At its simplest:

```python
# Instead of logging into Instagram, TikTok, YouTube...
# Make one API call
analytics = api.get_analytics(account_id="abc123")

# Get unified metrics
print(analytics.impressions)      # 1,234,567
print(analytics.engagement_rate)  # 4.2%
print(analytics.followers)        # 50,000
```

The power is in automation and aggregation:

- **Automation:** Pull metrics programmatically on a schedule, no manual work
- **Aggregation:** Combine data from multiple platforms into unified reports
- **Historization:** Store historical data that platforms often don't preserve long-term
- **Normalization:** Translate platform-specific metrics into comparable formats

## Why Platform-Native Analytics Aren't Enough

Every social platform offers some form of analytics. Instagram has Insights. TikTok has Analytics. YouTube has Studio. So why would you need an API?

### 1. Manual Access Doesn't Scale

If you manage one account, native dashboards work fine. If you manage 10 accounts across 5 platforms, you're spending hours on data collection that should be automated.

### 2. Data Retention Is Limited

Most platforms only retain detailed analytics for 30-90 days. If you need to compare this January to last January, that data is gone unless you've been exporting it.

### 3. Cross-Platform Comparison Is Painful

Try comparing "engagement rate" across platforms. Instagram calculates it one way. LinkedIn calculates it another. TikTok doesn't even provide it directly - you have to compute it yourself. Without normalization, you're comparing apples to oranges.

### 4. Building Features Requires APIs

If you're building a SaaS product, a client dashboard, or an internal reporting tool, you can't tell users to "just check Instagram manually." You need programmatic access.

### 5. Executive Reporting Needs Aggregation

Leadership doesn't want five separate reports. They want one dashboard that shows total reach, total engagement, and growth trends across all channels.

## The Challenge: Every Platform Is Different

Before diving into solutions, you need to understand the problem. Each platform's analytics API is its own world.

### Instagram (Graph API)

**Available Metrics:**
- Profile: impressions, reach, profile views, website clicks, followers
- Posts: impressions, reach, likes, comments, saves, shares (Reels only)
- Stories: impressions, reach, exits, replies, taps forward/back
- Reels: plays, reach, likes, comments, shares, saves

**Demographics Available:**
- Follower breakdown by country, city, age, gender
- Engaged audience breakdown (who interacted this month)
- Follows/unfollows over time

**Limitations:**
- Story metrics available only for 24 hours after story expires
- Demographics require Business/Creator account
- 30-day rolling window for most historical data

### TikTok (Business API)

**Available Metrics:**
- Profile: video views, followers, profile views, likes (total)
- Videos: views, likes, comments, shares, watch time, completion rate

**Demographics Available:**
- Audience ages
- Audience cities
- Engaged audience breakdown

**Limitations:**
- Requires Business Account
- API approval process takes weeks
- Some metrics only available in aggregate (30-day windows)

### YouTube (Data API v3)

**Available Metrics:**
- Channel: views, subscribers, video count, estimated watch time
- Videos: views, likes, dislikes, comments, favorites, average view duration

**Demographics Available:**
- Viewer age groups
- Viewer gender
- Traffic sources
- Geography

**Limitations:**
- Quota system limits API calls (10,000 units/day default)
- Video upload costs 1,600 units - analytics calls cost less but add up
- Detailed demographics require YouTube Analytics API (separate)

### LinkedIn (Marketing API)

**Available Metrics (Personal):**
- Posts: impressions, unique impressions, reactions, comments, reshares
- Videos: video plays, viewers, watch time, completion rate, average watch time

**Available Metrics (Company Pages):**
- Page: page views, unique visitors, followers
- Posts: impressions, clicks, engagement rate, reactions, comments, shares

**Limitations:**
- Personal and company analytics are completely different APIs
- Rate limits are restrictive
- Historical data access is limited

### Facebook (Graph API)

**Available Metrics:**
- Page: page views, page impressions, followers
- Posts: impressions, reach, reactions (like, love, wow, haha, angry), comments, shares, saves
- Videos: views, unique views, average watch time, click-to-play
- Reels: plays, reach, reactions

**Limitations:**
- Organic vs. paid metrics are separate
- Video metrics differ significantly from photo/link posts
- Requires Page access tokens (more complex OAuth)

### And That's Just Five Platforms...

[Pinterest](/api-reference/platforms/pinterest) has pin impressions, saves, and outbound clicks. [Reddit](/api-reference/platforms/reddit) has karma, upvotes, and comment counts. [Threads](/api-reference/platforms/threads) has views, likes, reposts, and quotes. [Google Business Profile](/api-reference/platforms/google-business) tracks impressions across maps and search, plus calls and direction requests.

Each platform:
- Uses different terminology
- Measures things differently
- Has different API access requirements
- Returns data in different formats

**This is why unified analytics APIs exist.**

## What a Good Social Media Analytics API Should Provide

When evaluating social media analytics APIs, here's what matters:

### 1. Normalized Metrics Across Platforms

The API should translate platform-specific metrics into a consistent schema:

| Normalized Field | Instagram | TikTok | YouTube | LinkedIn |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `impressions` | impressions | video_views | views | impressions |
| `impressionsUnique` | reach | unique_views | (N/A) | unique_impressions |
| `likes` | likes | likes | likes | reactions |
| `comments` | comments | comments | comments | comments |
| `shares` | shares | shares | (N/A) | reshares |
| `saves` | saved | (N/A) | favorites | (N/A) |
| `followers` | followers_count | followers | subscribers | followers |

This lets you compare performance across platforms without mental gymnastics.

### 2. Both Account-Level and Post-Level Analytics

**Account-level (social account analytics):**
- Follower growth
- Total impressions/reach
- Overall engagement
- Profile/page views

**Post-level (content analytics):**
- Per-post impressions, likes, comments
- Video-specific metrics (watch time, completion rate)
- Content performance comparison

You need both to understand channel health AND content performance.

### 3. Raw Data Access

Normalized data is great for dashboards. But sometimes you need the raw platform response - every field, exactly as the platform returned it.

**Why raw data matters:**
- Platform-specific metrics that don't normalize well
- Debugging discrepancies between your data and native dashboards
- Future-proofing (if a new metric appears, raw data captures it)
- Custom calculations beyond standard normalization

A good analytics API stores both normalized AND raw responses.

### 4. Demographic and Audience Data

Beyond engagement metrics, you need to understand WHO your audience is:

**Demographics:**
- Age breakdown
- Gender breakdown
- Geographic distribution (country, city)

**Audience Insights:**
- Follower vs. engaged audience differences
- Audience growth over time
- Audience overlap across platforms

This data is essential for content strategy, ad targeting, and understanding market fit.

### 5. Historical Data Retention

Platforms often only keep 30-90 days of detailed analytics. A good analytics API should:
- Store historical data long-term
- Let you query trends over months/years
- Preserve data even after platform retention expires

### 6. Automatic Refresh and Webhooks

Analytics data changes constantly. A good API should:
- Automatically refresh metrics on a configurable schedule
- Support force-refresh when you need real-time data
- Send [webhooks](/api-reference/webhooks) when significant changes occur

## How bundle.social Handles Analytics

Let me walk you through what we've built. This isn't just marketing - it's the technical reality of our analytics infrastructure.

![bundle.social Analytics API Endpoints](/images/blog/analytics-api-swagger.png)

### Platforms We Cover

We pull analytics from 11 platforms:

1. **[Instagram](/api-reference/platforms/instagram)** - full suite including demographics
2. **[TikTok](/api-reference/platforms/tiktok)** - account and video analytics with audience data
3. **[YouTube](/api-reference/platforms/youtube)** - channel and video metrics
4. **[LinkedIn](/api-reference/platforms/linkedin)** - personal AND company page analytics
5. **[Facebook](/api-reference/platforms/facebook)** - page and post analytics including Reels
6. **[Threads](/api-reference/platforms/threads)** - views, likes, replies, reposts
7. **[Pinterest](/api-reference/platforms/pinterest)** - impressions, saves, clicks
8. **[Reddit](/api-reference/platforms/reddit)** - karma, upvotes, comments
9. **[Google Business Profile](/api-reference/platforms/google-business)** - impressions, calls, direction requests
10. **[Mastodon](/api-reference/platforms/mastodon)** - followers, favourites, reblogs
11. **[Bluesky](/api-reference/platforms/bluesky)** - followers, likes, reposts

### Normalized Schema

Every platform maps to our unified schema:

```typescript
// Account-level analytics
{
  impressions: number,
  impressionsUnique: number,
  views: number,
  viewsUnique: number,
  likes: number,
  comments: number,
  postCount: number,
  followers: number,
  following: number,
  createdAt: timestamp,
  updatedAt: timestamp
}

// Post-level analytics  
{
  impressions: number,
  impressionsUnique: number,
  views: number,
  viewsUnique: number,
  likes: number,
  dislikes: number,
  comments: number,
  shares: number,
  saves: number,
  raw: object  // Original platform response
}
```

This lets you run queries like "show me total engagement across all platforms" without platform-specific logic.

### Raw Analytics Storage

We store the complete, unmodified platform response alongside normalized data. When you need it:

```bash
GET /api/v1/analytics/social-account/raw?socialAccountId=abc123
```

Returns everything the platform sent - audience ages, cities, engaged audience breakdowns, platform-specific metrics that don't fit our normalized schema.

**Configurable per organization:**
- `rawTiktokAnalyticsEnabled` - store complete TikTok response including demographics
- `rawInstagramDemographicsEnabled` - store follower demographics, audience splits, follows/unfollows

### Instagram Demographics Deep Dive

When enabled, we capture Instagram's full demographic breakdown:

**Follower Demographics:**

```json
{
  "follower_demographics": {
    "country": [
      {"code": "US", "value": 45.2},
      {"code": "UK", "value": 12.8},
      {"code": "CA", "value": 8.1}
    ],
    "city": [
      {"name": "Los Angeles", "value": 8.4},
      {"name": "New York", "value": 7.2},
      {"name": "London", "value": 5.1}
    ],
    "age": [
      {"range": "18-24", "value": 28.5},
      {"range": "25-34", "value": 42.1},
      {"range": "35-44", "value": 18.3}
    ],
    "gender": [
      {"type": "female", "value": 62.4},
      {"type": "male", "value": 36.1},
      {"type": "other", "value": 1.5}
    ]
  }
}
```

**Engaged Audience (This Month):**
Same breakdown, but for people who actually interacted with your content - not just followers. This is powerful for understanding whether your content resonates with your target demographic.

**Follows/Unfollows Trend:**
Daily data showing follower gains and losses over a 30-day window. Essential for correlating content strategy with audience growth.

### TikTok Audience Insights

When raw TikTok analytics are enabled:

```json
{
  "audience_ages": [
    {"age_range": "18-24", "percentage": 35.2},
    {"age_range": "25-34", "percentage": 28.7}
  ],
  "audience_cities": [
    {"city": "Los Angeles", "percentage": 12.1},
    {"city": "New York", "percentage": 9.8}
  ],
  "engaged_audience": {
    // Breakdown of who actually engaged
  }
}
```

### LinkedIn Video Analytics

LinkedIn provides rich video metrics that we capture:

```json
{
  "video_analytics": {
    "views": 15234,
    "unique_viewers": 12891,
    "watch_time_seconds": 45678,
    "average_watch_time_seconds": 3.2,
    "completion_rate": 0.42,
    "engagement_rate": 0.058
  }
}
```

This lets you understand not just IF people watched, but HOW they watched - crucial for video content strategy.

### Bulk Analytics Retrieval

When you need analytics for many posts at once:

```bash
GET /api/v1/analytics/post/bulk?postIds=id1,id2,id3...&limit=60
```

Paginated response for up to 60 posts per request. Essential for building dashboards and reports.

### Force Refresh

Platform analytics update on their own schedule. When you need real-time data:

```bash
POST /api/v1/analytics/social-account/force
POST /api/v1/analytics/post/force
```

Force refreshes are [rate-limited](/api-reference/rate-limits) per organization to prevent abuse.

### Configurable Refresh Intervals

Different use cases need different freshness:

- `analyticsInterval` - how often we automatically refresh account analytics
- `analyticsPostsInterval` - how often we refresh post analytics

Configure based on your needs. Real-time dashboard? Refresh frequently. Monthly reports? Daily refresh is fine.

## Code Examples: Using the Analytics API

### Get Account Analytics (Node.js)

Using our [SDK](/api-reference/sdk):

```typescript
import BundleSocial from 'bundlesocial';

const client = new BundleSocial({ apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY' });

async function getAccountAnalytics(socialAccountId: string) {
  const analytics = await client.analytics.getSocialAccount({
    socialAccountId
  });
  
  console.log(`Followers: ${analytics.followers}`);
  console.log(`Impressions: ${analytics.impressions}`);
  console.log(`Engagement: ${analytics.likes + analytics.comments}`);
  console.log(`Last updated: ${analytics.updatedAt}`);
}
```

### Get Post Analytics (Python)

```python
import requests

API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
BASE_URL = "https://api.bundle.social/api/v1"

def get_post_analytics(post_id: str):
    response = requests.get(
        f"{BASE_URL}/analytics/post",
        headers={"x-api-key": API_KEY},
        params={"postId": post_id}
    )
    
    data = response.json()
    
    print(f"Impressions: {data['impressions']}")
    print(f"Likes: {data['likes']}")
    print(f"Comments: {data['comments']}")
    print(f"Shares: {data['shares']}")
    print(f"Saves: {data['saves']}")
    
    return data

def get_raw_analytics(post_id: str):
    """Get the complete platform response"""
    response = requests.get(
        f"{BASE_URL}/analytics/post/raw",
        headers={"x-api-key": API_KEY},
        params={"postId": post_id}
    )
    
    # Returns everything the platform sent
    return response.json()
```

### Bulk Analytics for Reporting

```python
def get_bulk_analytics(post_ids: list):
    """Get analytics for multiple posts at once"""
    response = requests.get(
        f"{BASE_URL}/analytics/post/bulk",
        headers={"x-api-key": API_KEY},
        params={
            "postIds": ",".join(post_ids),
            "limit": 60
        }
    )
    
    data = response.json()
    
    # Aggregate metrics
    total_impressions = sum(p['impressions'] for p in data['items'])
    total_engagement = sum(p['likes'] + p['comments'] for p in data['items'])
    
    print(f"Total impressions: {total_impressions}")
    print(f"Total engagement: {total_engagement}")
    print(f"Average engagement per post: {total_engagement / len(data['items']):.1f}")
    
    return data
```

### Cross-Platform Comparison

```python
def compare_platforms(account_ids: dict):
    """
    account_ids = {
        "instagram": "ig_account_id",
        "tiktok": "tt_account_id", 
        "youtube": "yt_account_id"
    }
    """
    results = {}
    
    for platform, account_id in account_ids.items():
        analytics = requests.get(
            f"{BASE_URL}/analytics/social-account",
            headers={"x-api-key": API_KEY},
            params={"socialAccountId": account_id}
        ).json()
        
        results[platform] = {
            "followers": analytics["followers"],
            "impressions": analytics["impressions"],
            "engagement": analytics["likes"] + analytics["comments"]
        }
    
    # Now you can compare normalized data across platforms
    print("\n--- Cross-Platform Comparison ---")
    for platform, metrics in results.items():
        print(f"{platform.upper()}")
        print(f"  Followers: {metrics['followers']:,}")
        print(f"  Impressions: {metrics['impressions']:,}")
        print(f"  Engagement: {metrics['engagement']:,}")
```

## Use Cases: What You Can Build

If you have specific analytics needs not covered by our current offering, reach out. We're actively building based on customer requirements.

## Why Not Build It Yourself?

You could build direct integrations to each platform's analytics API. Here's why that's usually a bad idea:

### Time Investment

| Platform | Analytics Integration Time |
| :--- | :--- |
| Instagram | 30-40 hours |
| TikTok | 25-35 hours |
| YouTube | 35-45 hours |
| LinkedIn | 30-40 hours |
| Facebook | 25-35 hours |
| **Total** | **145-195 hours** |

Plus: different OAuth flows, different [rate limits](/api-reference/rate-limits), different data formats, ongoing maintenance.

### Maintenance Burden

- Instagram Graph API changes quarterly
- TikTok deprecated their old API entirely
- LinkedIn's analytics endpoints shift regularly
- You're responsible for handling every breaking change

### Data Normalization Is Hard

Getting "engagement" to mean the same thing across platforms requires:
- Deep understanding of each platform's metrics
- Careful mapping decisions
- Ongoing adjustment as platforms add/change metrics

### Storage and Historization

Platforms don't keep historical data forever. Building your own data warehouse adds:
- Database infrastructure
- Data retention policies
- Backup and recovery
