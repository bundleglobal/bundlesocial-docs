## TL;DR

- **Authentication:** OAuth 2.0 isn't just a login button - it's a token lifecycle you need to manage with background refresh jobs.
- **Publishing:** Sending media requires multi-step "container" flows. You can't just POST a video file.
- **Analytics:** There's no standard definition for "engagement." Your database schema needs to handle platform inconsistencies.
- **Webhooks:** Polling is dead. Real-time notifications require a verification handshake most developers get wrong.
- **Compliance:** GDPR data deletion callbacks will get your app banned if you ignore them.

## Introduction: The "Black Box" of Social Media

If you're trying to figure out how to integrate a marketing platform with social media APIs without losing your mind - you're in the right place.

Maybe you're a startup founder building an AI content tool. Maybe you're an engineer tasked with adding "Share to LinkedIn" to a legacy CRM. Or maybe you're just curious what a social media API actually does under the hood.

Here's the thing: Social Media APIs aren't just "pipes." They're living systems with strict rules, changing moods (rate limits), and distinct personalities. [Twitter](/api-reference/platforms/twitter) is strict. [TikTok](/api-reference/platforms/tiktok) is chaotic. [LinkedIn](/api-reference/platforms/linkedin) is corporate. Each one will break your code in unique and exciting ways.

This isn't a fluff piece. This is the technical handbook on how to architect a social media API integration that survives production.

## Phase 1: The Gatekeeper (Authentication & Security)

Everything starts with access. Get this wrong and nothing else matters.

### The OAuth 2.0 Reality

Forget passwords. You'll live and die by OAuth 2.0.

But implementing it isn't just about the "Login" button. It's about the lifecycle of the token.

**Short-Lived vs. Long-Lived Tokens**

Most platforms give you a short-lived token (valid for 1-2 hours) initially. You must immediately exchange this for a long-lived token (valid for 60 days). Miss this step and your users get logged out by lunch.

**The Refresh Loop**

Even long-lived tokens expire. You need a background worker - a cron job - that scans your database for tokens expiring in less than 3 days and hits the `refresh_token` endpoint.

<Warning>
Facebook tokens can sometimes change completely during a refresh. Always update your database with the new response. Never assume the string stays the same.
</Warning>

### Scopes: The Least Privilege Rule

When requesting permissions, be surgical.

**Don't ask for:**
- `manage_pages` (Global Admin access)

**Do ask for:**
- `pages_show_list`
- `pages_read_engagement`
- `pages_manage_posts`

<Note>
Is social media API integration safe? Yes - if you treat tokens like nuclear launch codes. Encrypt them at rest. Never log them in your console. Ever.
</Note>

## Phase 2: The Engine (Publishing Content)

Sending text is easy. Sending media is where developers cry.

### The "Media Container" Problem

You can't just POST a video file to [Instagram](/api-reference/platforms/instagram) or [Facebook](/api-reference/platforms/facebook). These platforms require a multi-step flow:

1. **Initialize:** "I want to upload a 50MB video." You get a Container ID back.
2. **Append:** Upload the binary data to that container.
3. **Finalize:** "I'm done uploading." The platform starts processing.
4. **Publish:** "Take Container ID #123 and put it on the feed."

The trap? Steps 3 and 4 are asynchronous. If you try to publish immediately after finalize, it fails because the video is "still encoding." You have to poll the status until it returns `READY`.

> Instagram's container-based publishing requires polling the status_code field. Only publish when status is `FINISHED`. - [Meta Graph API Documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/guides/content-publishing)

### Aspect Ratios and Codecs

If you're building a mobile integration, pay attention here.

- **Instagram Reels:** Must be 9:16 aspect ratio. Send 16:9 and the API rejects it outright.
- **TikTok:** Requires AAC audio codec specifically.
- **Twitter:** Strict file size limits - 512MB for Business accounts, less for others.

**Best Practice:** Build a "Sanitizer" service in your backend that checks file metadata with FFmpeg before you even try sending it to the API. We do this at bundle.social and it catches 90% of upload failures before they happen.

## Phase 3: The Feedback Loop (Analytics & Data)

You posted the content. Now the client asks: "Did it go viral?"

### The Metric Mismatch

There's no standard definition for "Engagement" across platforms.

- **Impressions:** How many times content appeared on screen
- **Reach:** How many unique humans saw it
- **Engagement:** Clicks + Likes + Comments + Shares (varies by platform)

The challenge? A free analytics tier might give you impressions as an integer (`100`), while an enterprise tier gives you demographics as JSON (`{"US": 50, "UK": 50}`). Your database schema needs to handle both.

For a deeper dive on normalizing this data, check our [social media analytics guide](/blog/social-media-analytics-for-beginners).

### Historical Data vs. Real-Time

Do not query analytics APIs in real-time when a user loads a dashboard.

Why? [Rate limits](/api-reference/rate-limits).

**The fix:** Implement snapshotting. Every night at 2 AM, your server queries the API for yesterday's stats and saves a static snapshot in your database. Your dashboard reads from your DB, not the API. This is how we handle analytics at scale.

## Phase 4: The Nervous System (Webhooks & Listening)

Polling - asking "any new data?" repeatedly - is dead. Webhooks - listening for data pushes - are the future.

### Why Webhooks Matter

For enterprise integrations, speed is everything. If a customer complains on Twitter, a 15-minute polling delay is unacceptable.

Webhooks push that notification to your server in under 2 seconds.

### The Verification Handshake

Setting up webhooks is tricky. Most developers get this wrong on the first try.

When you register a webhook URL:
1. The platform sends a GET request with a random `challenge` string
2. Your server must immediately echo back that exact challenge string
3. This proves you own the server

Fail this handshake and the webhook gets disabled. No error message. Just silence.

For implementation details, see our [webhooks documentation](/api-reference/webhooks).

## Phase 5: Compliance (The Boring but Deadly Part)

Ignoring this section will get your app banned. I've seen it happen.

### Data Deletion Requests (GDPR/CCPA)

Facebook and others require a "Data Deletion Callback URL."

Here's what happens:
1. User removes your app from their Facebook settings
2. Facebook sends a ping to your callback URL
3. You must delete their data and respond with a confirmation code
4. If you fail to handle these, your app gets flagged during the annual Data Use Checkup

<Warning>
Meta runs annual audits. Apps that don't properly handle data deletion requests get suspended. No appeals process - you just lose access.
</Warning>

### Platform Terms of Service

Each platform has specific restrictions:

- **YouTube:** You cannot mix YouTube API data with data from other platforms on the same screen (in some contexts)
- **Instagram:** You cannot use their API for "surveillance" tools
- **TikTok:** Requires video walkthrough of your app during review process

## The Full Stack Reality

Building a social media API integration isn't a weekend feature. It's a full-time product commitment.

You need:
- **Backend:** OAuth flows, cron jobs for token refresh, media processing
- **Storage:** Snapshots for analytics, encrypted token storage
- **Media Processing:** FFmpeg for format validation, resizing
- **Legal:** GDPR compliance, data deletion handlers

### The Strategic Choice

If you have a team of 5 engineers dedicated to this, go ahead and build direct integrations. You'll learn a lot. You'll also spend 6 months on something that isn't your core product.

The alternative? Use an abstraction layer that handles the OAuth lifecycle, media sanitization, and compliance webhooks for you. Whether that's us or someone else - the point is to ship your actual product, not become a social media API maintenance team.
