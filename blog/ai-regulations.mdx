The days of stealth-dropping AI content are over. Major platforms are rolling out strict requirements for labeling AI-generated media. If you are building a tool that uses GenAI to create posts, you **must** comply or risk getting your API access revoked.

## The `is_generated` Flag

Platforms are standardizing on a boolean flag in their API payloads.

### [YouTube](/api-reference/platforms/youtube)
YouTube requires you to disclose if content is "synthetic."
*   **Field:** `syntheticMedia` (boolean)
*   **Requirement:** Must be true if the video contains AI-generated scenes, voices, or realistic events that didn't happen.

### [Instagram](/api-reference/platforms/instagram) & [Facebook](/api-reference/platforms/facebook)
Meta is rolling out "Made with AI" labels.
*   **Field:** `is_generated` (boolean) in the metadata.
*   **Consequence:** If you fail to label it and they detect it (which they will), they downrank your content.

### [TikTok](/api-reference/platforms/tiktok)
TikTok requires the `AIGenerated` attribute.
*   **Policy:** Content must be clearly labeled.

## How to handle this in bundle.social

We abstract this for you, but you still need to tell us.

```javascript
await bundle.post.create({
  data: {
    YOUTUBE: {
      syntheticMedia: true // <-- Don't forget this
    },
    TIKTOK: {
      aiGenerated: true
    }
  }
});
```

## Conclusion

Compliance isn't optional. Update your UI to include an "AI Generated" checkbox for your users, and pass that data to the API. It's better to be transparent than banned.
