## When Is the Best Time to Post on [TikTok](/api-reference/platforms/tiktok)?
TikTok’s fast-paced, visually engaging platform has taken the world by storm, and
figuring out the best time to post on TikTok can be a game-changer for both content
creators and small business owners. With 1.534 billion users worldwide, getting your
content in front of the right audience at the right time can drastically improve
your reach and engagement. In this guide, we’ll explore the best practices for posting
on TikTok, based on data and insights.

## Is There a Universal Best Time to Post on TikTok?
While we all wish there were a magic formula for the perfect TikTok posting time,
the reality is that there is no single best time that works for every creator or
video. The best time to post depends on factors like your audience, their behavior,
and the type of content you share.

## Best Times to Post on TikTok at a Glance
Here are the best times to post on TikTok, based on data:

- Monday: 10 a.m.
- Tuesday: 4 p.m.
- Wednesday: 4 p.m.
- Thursday: 10 a.m.
- Friday: 8 a.m.
- Saturday: 11 a.m.
- Sunday: 2 p.m.

These times reflect peak engagement periods when TikTok users are most active, but you should always experiment with different times to see what works best for your specific audience.

## Why Timing Matters on TikTok
Posting at the right time can be the difference between your video getting a few
views or landing on thousands of For You Pages (FYP). TikTok’s algorithm favors videos
that quickly gain engagement, so posting during peak hours increases the likelihood
that users will interact with your content right away.

## Best Times to Post by Day
Here’s a closer look at the best times to post on TikTok for each day of the week:

## Best Time to Post on TikTok on Monday: 10 a.m.
Mondays see a spike in activity mid-morning. Posting at 10 a.m. will give your content
a better chance of reaching users as they start their week.

## Best Time to Post on TikTok on Tuesday: 4 p.m.
Tuesday at 4 p.m. is a strong time for posting. The late afternoon window sees a
surge in users checking their phones after work or school.

## Best Time to Post on TikTok on Wednesday: 4 p.m.
Mid-week engagement peaks at 4 p.m. on Wednesdays. Posting during this time can help
you capture users who are winding down and looking for some entertainment.

## Best Time to Post on TikTok on Thursday: 10 a.m.
Thursdays are great for morning posts. Scheduling your content for 10 a.m. allows
it to gain momentum throughout the day.

## Best Time to Post on TikTok on Friday: 8 a.m.
Friday at 8 a.m. is an ideal time to post as users check TikTok early in the day,
especially before kicking off their weekend.

## Best Time to Post on TikTok on Saturday: 11 a.m.
Although Saturdays are generally slower for engagement, posting at 11 a.m. can still
help your content reach viewers who are relaxing and scrolling through the app.

## Best Time to Post on TikTok on Sunday: 2 p.m.
Sundays have one of the highest engagement peaks of the week, particularly at 2 p.m.
when users are winding down their weekend.

## What Is the Best Day to Post on TikTok?
According to data, Tuesday is the best day to post on TikTok, followed closely by
Thursday, Monday, and Friday. The weekends, particularly Saturday, tend to have lower
engagement, so it’s best to focus your efforts earlier in the week.
