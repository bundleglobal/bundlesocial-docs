When you build a social media tool, you assume the main cost will be the API calls.
Then you add video support.

## The Invoice Shock

Video is expensive.
1.  **Ingress/Egress:** Users upload 4K raw files. AWS charges you to receive them (time) and serve them (bandwidth).
2.  **Storage:** You need to store that 2GB file while it processes.
3.  **Compute:** You need to validate the file. Is it actually MP4? Is the codec supported by [Instagram](/api-reference/platforms/instagram)? You spin up FFMPEG instances. CPU usage spikes.

## The Complexity Tax

It's not just money. It's code.
*   Handling resumable uploads (because connections drop).
*   Validating aspect ratios (Instagram Reels vs [YouTube](/api-reference/platforms/youtube) Shorts).
*   Managing async processing queues.

## Our Solution

We handle the heavy lifting.
*   You send us the file via our **Resumable Upload API**.
*   We validate it, check platform compliance, and store it temporarily.
*   We push it to the network.

You pay for the API call, not the FFMPEG cluster.
