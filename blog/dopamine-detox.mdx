There is a supreme irony in being a developer for social media tools. To build them, you have to understand them. To understand them, you have to use them.

And using them for 10 hours a day is a recipe for burnout.

## The "Always On" Problem

When you integrate with APIs like [Twitter](/api-reference/platforms/twitter) or [TikTok](/api-reference/platforms/tiktok), you are essentially plugging your brain into a firehose of content. You aren't just scrolling; you are debugging the scroll. You are analyzing the engagement. You are checking if the webhook fired.

It's not "doomscrolling," it's "work." But your brain doesn't know the difference.

## Automation as Self-Care

The best way to detach is to trust your code.

1.  **Automate Monitoring:** Don't check if the post went out. Build a webhook listener that pings you *only* if it failed.
2.  **Batch Your Testing:** Don't "test in prod" on your personal account all day. Set aside specific windows for QA.
3.  **Trust the Abstracton:** Use tools (like bundle.social) that handle the chaotic parts of the platforms for you. We deal with the API changes so you don't have to panic-scroll Twitter looking for updates.

## Conclusion

Build the tool, ship the code, and then **log off**. Let the servers handle the dopamine hits.
