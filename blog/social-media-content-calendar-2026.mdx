## Plan smarter and post with confidence
Keeping a steady content rhythm is hard. A simple calendar makes it easy. This guide gives you a free 2026 content calendar template and a clear process to plan posts that grow reach and save time.

## What you get in the template
- Monthly view for 2026 with key reminders
- Weekly planning blocks for ideas, drafts, approvals, and publishing
- Space for goals, themes, and campaign notes
- Columns for platform, format, owner, status, and link to assets

## How to use it in 15 minutes each week
### 1. Pick a monthly theme
Choose a simple theme that supports your goals. Awareness, launch, education, community, or support.

### 2. Draft 6 to 12 post ideas
Mix formats. One educational post. One story. One proof. One community prompt. One short video. One carousel or thread.

### 3. Match ideas to platforms
Repurpose smartly. Turn a how to into a Reel, a [TikTok](/api-reference/platforms/tiktok), and a [LinkedIn](/api-reference/platforms/linkedin) post. Keep the hook native to each platform.

### 4. Schedule and automate
Batch schedule for the week so you are not stuck posting at odd hours.
