To maximize social media reach in 2024, focus on posting when your audience is most active. Prime posting times include evenings at 7:00 PM, afternoons at 3:15 PM, and mornings at 8:41 AM. For hourly engagement, aim for 9:00 AM, 7:00 PM, and 10:00 AM. Avoid the early hours of 2:00 AM to 3:00 AM, as they're least effective. The top 0.5% of organizations find success posting at noon, 6:00 PM, and 9:00 AM. Tailoring your posts to these times can enhance interaction with your content.
