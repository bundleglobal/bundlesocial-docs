Social media is great. The comments section... not always.
As a developer building social tools, you have a responsibility to protect your users.

## The Moderator's API Toolkit

Most platforms expose moderation endpoints that you can automate.

### 1. Hide Comments Automatically
You can use `bundle.social` or native APIs to fetch comments, analyze them with an LLM for sentiment/toxicity, and then hide them.

### 2. Disable Like Counts
[Instagram](/api-reference/platforms/instagram) allows you to hide like counts on posts via API (`hide_likes` flag). This reduces performance anxiety for creators.

### 3. Restrict Replies
Twitter/X allows you to limit who can reply to a tweet (e.g., only people you mention).

## Building "Humane" Tools

Don't just build a tool that maximizes engagement. Build a tool that maximizes sanity.
*   Add a "Zen Mode" that hides metrics.
*   Add an "Auto-Block" feature for spam.

The API gives you the power to change the interface. Use it.
