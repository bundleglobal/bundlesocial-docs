Bobby Kotick's departure from Activision Blizzard marked the end of an era. While the headlines focused on culture and controversy, for us in the tech world, it's a lesson in stability and trust.

## The Developer's Dilemma

When a platform (or a company) is in turmoil, the first casualty is often the ecosystem. APIs get deprecated, support vanishes, and roadmaps are shredded.

We saw this with:
*   **Twitter/X:** When the leadership changed, the API was decimated overnight. Developers who built businesses on top of it were left stranded.
*   **[Reddit](/api-reference/platforms/reddit):** Pricing changes killed popular 3rd party apps.

## Building for the Long Haul

At bundle.social, we believe your infrastructure shouldn't be subject to the whims of corporate chaos. We abstract away the instability of underlying platforms.

*   **[Twitter](/api-reference/platforms/twitter) changed their API?** We handle the migration. You don't rewrite your code.
*   **[Facebook](/api-reference/platforms/facebook) updated their Graph API version?** We upgrade it backend-side. Your integration keeps working.

## Conclusion

You can't control what Blizzard, Microsoft, or Elon Musk do. But you can choose infrastructure that shields you from the blast radius.
