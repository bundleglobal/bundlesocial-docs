## TL;DR

- **Standard tweets:** 280 characters max
- **X Premium tweets:** Up to 25,000 characters
- **DMs:** 10,000 characters
- **Bio:** 160 characters
- **Display name:** 50 characters
- **Username:** 15 characters
- **Alt text:** 1,000 characters

## Why Character Counts Matter on X

X (formerly Twitter) built its identity on brevity. The original 140-character limit forced users to be concise. When they doubled it to 280 in 2017, the platform kept its punchy, fast-scrolling feel.

But here's what trips people up: not all characters are equal. URLs, emojis, and mentions eat into your count differently than plain text. If you've ever written what seemed like a short tweet only to see "Your post is over the character limit" - you've hit this problem.

Understanding the exact limits saves you from editing frustration and helps you craft posts that fit perfectly on the first try.

## The Complete X/Twitter Character Limits

### Tweets (Posts)

| Account Type | Character Limit |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Standard (free) | 280 characters |
| X Premium | 25,000 characters |
| X Premium+ | 25,000 characters |

Standard accounts get 280 characters. That's it. No exceptions.

X Premium subscribers can post up to 25,000 characters - essentially turning tweets into blog posts. But here's the catch: only the first 280 characters show in the timeline. Readers have to tap "Show more" to see the rest.

> Posts longer than 280 characters are truncated in the timeline. Only Premium subscribers can create them, but everyone can read them. - [X Help Center](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-x/x-premium)

### Direct Messages

DMs allow up to **10,000 characters** per message. This applies to both standard and Premium accounts.

### Profile Elements

| Element | Limit |
|---------|-------|
| Display name | 50 characters |
| Username (@handle) | 15 characters |
| Bio | 160 characters |
| Location | 30 characters |

Your bio is prime real estate. 160 characters to explain who you are and why someone should follow you. Use them wisely.

### Media Alt Text

Alt text for images is capped at **1,000 characters**. This is accessibility text for screen readers - describe what's in the image clearly.

## How Characters Are Counted

X counts characters using Unicode normalization. In practice, this means:

**1 character each:**
- Letters (A-Z, a-z)
- Numbers (0-9)
- Spaces
- Basic punctuation

**2 characters each:**
- Most emojis (yes, that heart costs you double)
- Some special characters
- Characters from certain languages (Chinese, Japanese, Korean)

**Special cases:**
- **URLs:** All URLs are shortened to 23 characters, regardless of actual length. A 100-character URL still counts as 23.
- **Mentions:** @username counts as its full length including the @ symbol
- **Hashtags:** Full length including the # symbol

<Note>
The 23-character URL rule is crucial for link-heavy tweets. A long tracking URL and a short bit.ly link cost the same character budget.
</Note>

## Counting Characters Correctly

### Quick Mental Math

For a typical tweet with text, one emoji, and one link:
- Your text: count normally
- Each emoji: add 2
- Your link: add 23

Example: "Check out our new guide" (23 chars) + link (23 chars) + 🚀 (2 chars) = 48 characters total.

### Using X's Built-in Counter

When composing a tweet on X (web or app), a circular progress indicator appears. It fills as you type:
- **Blue arc:** You're under the limit
- **Yellow arc:** Approaching the limit
- **Red arc:** Over the limit

The number inside shows remaining characters once you're close.

### Third-Party Character Counters

Several tools count characters before you paste into X:

- **charactercounter.com** - Simple web tool, shows character and word count
- **lettercount.com** - Includes X-specific counting mode
- **Your scheduling tool** - Most social media schedulers show character counts per platform

When you schedule X posts through an API or scheduling platform, the character count typically happens server-side before submission. If you're over the limit, the post fails with an error.

## Platform-Specific Quirks

### Threads (Multi-tweet Posts)

When creating a thread, each tweet in the thread has its own 280-character limit. The platform adds "1/5", "2/5" etc. automatically - this counts against your limit.

If you're numbering manually, factor that in: "1/10 " costs 5 characters.

### Quote Tweets

When you quote-tweet, you get the full 280 characters for your commentary. The quoted tweet appears as an embedded card and doesn't count against your limit.

### Replies

Replies also get 280 characters. The @mention of who you're replying to doesn't count against this limit - X handles that separately.

## Premium Long-Form: When to Use It

X Premium's 25,000-character posts are tempting for long-form content. But consider:

**Good use cases:**
- Detailed threads consolidated into one post
- Technical explanations that need space
- Essays or opinion pieces

**Bad use cases:**
- Anything that could be a normal thread (engagement is often better)
- Content that should be a blog post (SEO is better on your own site)
- Padding short ideas to seem more substantial

The timeline preview shows 280 characters max. If your hook isn't in those first 280, most people won't tap to read more.

## Character Limits for API Integrations

If you're posting to X via API (directly or through a scheduling platform), the character validation happens when you submit the post.

The [X API v2](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api) returns specific error codes:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Tweet text is too long",
      "code": 186
    }
  ]
}
```

Error code 186 means you exceeded the character limit. Your integration should validate length client-side before attempting to post.

<Warning>
X's API counts characters the same way the app does - including the 2-character emoji rule and 23-character URL shortening. Don't assume ASCII-only counting.
</Warning>

## Comparing X to Other Platforms

| Platform | Post Limit | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| X (standard) | 280 | Iconic short-form |
| X (Premium) | 25,000 | Long-form option |
| [Instagram](/api-reference/platforms/instagram) caption | 2,200 | But only ~125 show before "more" |
| [LinkedIn](/api-reference/platforms/linkedin) post | 3,000 | Professional context |
| [Facebook](/api-reference/platforms/facebook) post | 63,206 | Rarely used fully |
| [Threads](/api-reference/platforms/threads) | 500 | Meta's X competitor |
| [Bluesky](/api-reference/platforms/bluesky) | 300 | Decentralized alternative |

X's 280-character limit is among the shortest. This constraint is a feature, not a bug - it forces clarity and makes the timeline scannable.

## Tips for Writing Within the Limit

**1. Cut filler words**
- "In order to" → "To"
- "The fact that" → (delete)
- "I think that" → (just state the thought)

**2. Use numerals**
- "twenty-three" (12 chars) → "23" (2 chars)

**3. Strategic abbreviations**
- "with" → "w/" in casual contexts
- "versus" → "vs"

**4. Let the link work harder**
- Don't describe what's in the link. Just tease it.
- Bad: "Here's an article about character limits on Twitter" (53 chars)
- Good: "X character limits, explained" (29 chars) + link

**5. Split into threads**
- If you're fighting the limit, you probably have two thoughts. Make them two tweets.

**Posting to X programmatically?**

If you're building an app that posts to X, character validation should happen before you hit the API. Our [X/Twitter integration](/api-reference/platforms/twitter) handles limit validation automatically - posts over 280 fail gracefully with clear error messages telling you exactly how many characters to cut.
