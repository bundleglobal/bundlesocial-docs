The era of manual posting is ending. AI agents—software that can perceive, reason, and act—are taking over social media management. But there is a fine line between a helpful agent and a spambot.

## The Architecture of a Social Agent

To build a social agent that actually provides value, you need three layers:

1.  **The Brain (LLM):** OpenAI, Anthropic, or Llama. This generates the content.
2.  **The Context (RAG):** Your database of past posts, brand guidelines, and audience data.
3.  **The Hands (API):** Tools like **bundle.social** that execute the actions (post, comment, like).

### 1. The Context Layer (Don't hallucinate)

Don't just ask GPT-4 to "write a tweet." It will sound like a corporate robot.

Instead, inject context:
```json
{
  "role": "system",
  "content": "You are a senior engineer. Use the user's past 50 tweets (provided below) to mimic their tone. Be cynical but helpful."
}
```

### 2. The Execution Layer (Safety First)

An autonomous agent needs guardrails.

*   **Rate Limits:** Don't let your bot post 100 times an hour. The platform will ban you. Use `bundle.social`'s built-in queue to smooth out the bursts.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop:** For the first 100 posts, have a human approve them via a dashboard.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Use webhooks (`post.published`, `post.failed`) to retrain your agent. If a post failed validation, tell the LLM *why* so it learns.

## Conclusion

Building an AI agent is easy. Building one that doesn't get banned is hard. Use robust APIs to handle the execution layer so you can focus on the intelligence.
