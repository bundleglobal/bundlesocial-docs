## TL;DR / Key Takeaways

- Traditional white label = logo swap + color picker. You're still stuck in someone else's UI.
- API-first white label = build exactly what you want. Zero forced branding, ever.
- bundle.social offers a complete social media API covering 14+ platforms - no "Powered by" anywhere.
- Pricing based on posts, not seats or connected accounts. Scale without linear cost growth.
- The real ROI isn't just hiding a logo - it's owning the entire client experience.

You've probably seen the pitch: "White label our dashboard! Add your logo! Custom colors!"

Here's what they don't mention: your clients will still click "Help" and land on someone else's support docs. The onboarding emails will have their templates. And somewhere, buried in a footer or an error message, their brand will leak through.

That's not white label. That's a sticker on someone else's product.

At [bundle.social](https://bundle.social), we took a different approach. Instead of offering a "white-labelable dashboard," we built a complete REST API. You call our endpoints from your backend. Your clients see your interface, your domain, your brand. They never know we exist.

*Practically, bundle.social - your brand on top, our infrastructure underneath.*

## The Problem with Traditional White Label Tools

White label social media management software typically offers three tiers of customization:

**Tier 1 - Logo Swap:** Upload your logo, pick primary colors. The footer still says "Powered by [Tool]" unless you pay extra.

**Tier 2 - Custom Domain:** Point `app.youragency.com` to their servers. Better, but still their UI, their workflows, their feature set.

**Tier 3 - "Enterprise White Label":** Usually $500+/month. More customization, but you're still building within their constraints.

The fundamental problem? You're renting their house and hanging your pictures on the walls. The floor plan is fixed. The weird bathroom layout stays weird.

According to [HubSpot's State of Marketing Report](https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics), agencies with proprietary-looking tools command 25-40% higher retainers. But "proprietary-looking" and "actually yours" are different things.

<Note>
  **Real talk:** If a client can Google your tool's interface and find the original vendor, your white label is cosmetic at best. They'll wonder why they're paying you a markup.
</Note>

## What API-First White Label Actually Means

API-first means bundle.social handles the hard parts - OAuth tokens, platform rate limits, media encoding, API changes - while you control everything the client sees.

No dashboard to white label. No UI to customize. You build the interface from scratch, using our API as the backend.

Here's what that looks like in practice:

```javascript
// Your server calls our API - client never sees bundle.social
const response = await fetch('https://api.bundle.social/api/v1/post', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'x-api-key': process.env.BUNDLE_API_KEY,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    teamId: 'team_abc123',
    postDate: '2026-02-15T10:00:00Z',
    status: 'SCHEDULED',
    socialAccountTypes: ['INSTAGRAM', 'LINKEDIN', 'TIKTOK'],
    data: {
      INSTAGRAM: {
        type: 'POST',
        text: 'Client content here',
        uploadIds: ['upload_123']
      },
      LINKEDIN: {
        text: 'Client content here'
      },
      TIKTOK: {
        type: 'VIDEO',
        text: 'Client content here',
        uploadIds: ['upload_123'],
        privacy: 'PUBLIC_TO_EVERYONE'
      }
    }
  })
});
```

This runs on your server. Your client logs into your app at your domain. They see your scheduling calendar, your analytics dashboard, your branding everywhere. The underlying social media infrastructure is bundle.social, but that's an implementation detail they don't need to know.

## Why This Matters for Agencies

I've worked with agencies at companies like Reply and Docplanner. The pattern is always the same: agencies start with a traditional white label tool, hit its limitations within 6 months, and either accept the constraints or rebuild.

Common friction points:

**Client A needs TikTok, Client B doesn't.** Traditional white label shows both the same interface. With API-first, you build exactly what each client type needs.

**Your workflow doesn't match their workflow.** Most tools assume content → schedule → publish. What if your agency does approval → revision → approval → schedule? Traditional tools force workarounds. API gives you building blocks.

**Pricing doesn't scale.** Per-seat or per-account pricing means your costs grow linearly with clients. At bundle.social, we charge based on posts, not profiles. Connect 1 account or 500 - same pricing structure.

<Warning>
  **Heads up:** API-first requires development resources. If you don't have a developer (even part-time), traditional white label might be the faster path. There's no shame in shipping "good enough" today and rebuilding later.
</Warning>

## Platform Coverage

A white label solution is only useful if it covers the platforms your clients actually use.

bundle.social supports [14+ platforms](/api-reference/platforms):

| Platform | What's Supported |
|----------|------------------|
| [Instagram](/api-reference/platforms/instagram) | Posts, Stories, Reels, Carousels |
| [TikTok](/api-reference/platforms/tiktok) | Videos with privacy controls |
| [LinkedIn](/api-reference/platforms/linkedin) | Personal profiles + Company pages |
| [Facebook](/api-reference/platforms/facebook) | Pages, Groups, Reels |
| [YouTube](/api-reference/platforms/youtube) | Long-form + Shorts |
| [Twitter/X](/api-reference/platforms/twitter) | Tweets with media |
| [Threads](/api-reference/platforms/threads) | Text + images |
| [Pinterest](/api-reference/platforms/pinterest) | Pins to boards |
| [Reddit](/api-reference/platforms/reddit) | Subreddit posts |
| [Bluesky](/api-reference/platforms/bluesky) | Posts with images |
| [Discord](/api-reference/platforms/discord) | Channel webhooks |
| [Slack](/api-reference/platforms/slack) | Workspace messages |
| [Mastodon](/api-reference/platforms/mastodon) | Decentralized posts |
| [Google Business](/api-reference/platforms/google-business) | Local SEO posts |

Most traditional white label tools cover 5-6 platforms. When a client asks "can you post to Threads?" you don't want the answer to be "our tool doesn't support that yet."

## The Economics: Build vs. Buy vs. API

Let's talk numbers.

### Building Your Own Integrations

- **Development:** 40-80 hours per platform × $100/hour = $4,000-$8,000 per platform
- **For 5 platforms:** $20,000-$40,000 upfront
- **Timeline:** 3-6 months
- **Maintenance:** 10-20 hours/month × $100 = $1,000-$2,000/month ongoing
- **Risk:** Platforms change APIs constantly. TikTok alone has had 3 major API updates in the past year.

I've seen startups try this. Most abandon the project after 6 months of OAuth hell and rate limit debugging.

### Traditional White Label

- **Base cost:** $200-$500/month for white label access
- **Per-account fees:** $5-$20 per connected social profile
- **Hidden costs:** Premium tiers to remove branding, enterprise fees for API access

The math: 50 clients × 5 accounts each × $10/account = $2,500/month just in account fees. Plus base fee. Plus markup anxiety when clients discover the underlying tool.

### API-First (bundle.social)

- **Pro:** $100/month for 1,000 posts
- **Business:** $400/month for 100,000 posts
- **Enterprise:** Custom pricing for higher volume
- **White label:** Native. There's no branding to remove because there's no UI.
- **Scaling:** Connect unlimited accounts without linear cost growth

If you're doing volume, API-first wins on unit economics.

## What You Get with bundle.social API

Beyond posting, the API covers the full social media management workflow:

**[Upload & Media Handling](/api-reference/upload-content)**
We handle video transcoding, image resizing, format conversion. Upload once, we optimize for each platform's requirements.

**[Account Connection](/api-reference/connect-social-accounts)**
OAuth flows for all 14+ platforms. We handle token refresh, re-authentication prompts, permission scopes.

**[Webhooks](/api-reference/webhooks)**
Real-time notifications when posts publish, fail, or get engagement. Build alerts, dashboards, whatever you need.

**[SDK for TypeScript](/api-reference/sdk)**
If you're building in Node.js, the SDK handles auth headers and provides typed responses. Less boilerplate, fewer bugs.

```typescript
import { BundleSocial } from 'bundlesocial';

const bundle = new BundleSocial('pk_live_...');

// Upload media
const upload = await bundle.upload.uploadCreate({
  formData: {
    teamId: 'team_123',
    file: new Blob([videoBuffer], { type: 'video/mp4' }),
  }
});

// Create post
await bundle.post.postCreate({
  requestBody: {
    teamId: 'team_123',
    socialAccountTypes: ['TIKTOK', 'INSTAGRAM'],
    data: {
      TIKTOK: {
        text: 'Posted via your agency's platform',
        uploadIds: [upload.id],
        privacy: 'PUBLIC_TO_EVERYONE'
      },
      INSTAGRAM: {
        type: 'REEL',
        text: 'Posted via your agency's platform',
        uploadIds: [upload.id]
      }
    }
  }
});
```

## Real-World Implementation Path

If you're serious about API-first white label, here's a practical roadmap:

### Week 1-2: Proof of Concept
- Sign up for bundle.social, get API key
- Build a minimal posting flow for one platform (Instagram is a good start)
- Test with your own accounts

### Week 3-4: Core Features
- Add scheduling (set `status: 'SCHEDULED'` with future `postDate`)
- Implement media uploads
- Build a basic calendar view

### Month 2: Client-Ready MVP
- Multi-platform support
- Client workspace isolation (one team per client)
- Basic analytics display

### Month 3+: Differentiation
- Custom approval workflows
- AI content suggestions (integrate with OpenAI/Claude)
- White-labeled mobile app

The first version doesn't need to be feature-complete. Ship something that solves the core problem - scheduling posts without your clients seeing someone else's brand - then iterate.

<Note>
  **Pro tip:** Start with your least demanding client. They're more forgiving of rough edges and will give you real feedback without threatening to churn.
</Note>

## When Traditional White Label Makes Sense

I'm not going to pretend API-first is right for everyone.

**Choose traditional white label if:**
- You need to launch this week, not this month
- Zero development resources available
- Your clients have simple, standardized needs
- You're testing market demand before investing in custom build

**Choose API-first if:**
- You have even 10 hours/week of dev time available
- Different clients need different experiences
- You want to own the relationship completely
- You're building a product, not just reselling a service

The agencies I've seen succeed long-term almost always end up on API-first, but some start with traditional tools to validate the market first. Both paths work.

## Getting Started

Ready to try API-first white label?

1. **[Read the API docs](/api-reference/introduction)** - See what endpoints are available
2. **[Check the examples](/api-reference/examples)** - Copy-paste implementations for common patterns
3. **[Grab the SDK](/api-reference/sdk)** - TypeScript types make development faster

If you've already got a white label tool and want to migrate, we can help with the transition. The API is designed to slot into existing workflows without requiring a full rebuild.
