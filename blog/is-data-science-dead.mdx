title: "Social Analytics: The Nightmare of Data Normalization"
description: Why "Views" on TikTok are not the same as "Impressions" on Facebook.

If you've ever tried to build a unified analytics dashboard, you know the pain.

*   **[TikTok](/api-reference/platforms/tiktok)** calls it `video_views`.
*   **[Instagram](/api-reference/platforms/instagram)** calls it `impressions`.
*   **[LinkedIn](/api-reference/platforms/linkedin)** distinguishes between `uniqueImpressions` and `shareMentions`.
*   **[YouTube](/api-reference/platforms/youtube)** has `views` but also `redViews` (YouTube Premium).

## The Engineering Problem

Data Science isn't dead, but for social media, it's mostly a **Data Engineering** problem.

You need to:
1.  **Fetch** data from 10 different APIs with different rate limits.
2.  **Map** disparate fields to a common schema.
3.  **Handle** zeroes (Does `0` mean zero views, or "data not available"?).
4.  **Store** it in a way that allows for time-series comparison.

## Our Approach

At `bundle.social`, we spent months building a normalization layer. We decided that `Impressions` means "The number of times content was displayed," regardless of what the platform calls it.

We do the dirty work of mapping `facebook_page_impressions_unique_28_days` to `impressionsUnique` so you don't have to.
