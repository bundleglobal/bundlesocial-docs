## TL;DR

- **Getlate.dev:** Developer-focused social media API, newer in the space. Clean design, modern DX.
- **The Question:** Newer platforms need to prove reliability, error quality, support speed, and feature depth. That takes time.
- **bundle.social:** Production-tested at ~2% error rate, verbose error responses with platform context, analytics included, flat pricing, same-day support, features built on customer request.

## Evaluating Newer Platforms

Getlate.dev takes a developer-first approach to social media APIs. Clean design, focused functionality, modern developer experience. We respect that.

But newer also means less production history. When your product depends on a third-party API, track record matters - reliability under load, error quality when things break, support responsiveness when you're stuck, and staying power as a company. These things take time to prove.

Developers searching for Getlate.dev alternatives are usually weighing exactly these factors. Here's how to think through it, and where we fit.

## The Reliability Question

Our production error rate sits around 2%. That's been consistent over time, across platforms, under varying loads.

What does 2% mean in practice? Out of every 100 scheduled posts, 98 publish successfully. The 2 that fail are overwhelmingly external causes:

- Expired tokens (user revoked access or token naturally expired)
- Content policy rejections (the platform didn't like something)
- Platform outages (Instagram having a bad day, not our fault)

Failures we can't prevent, but we handle properly and surface clearly.

For newer platforms without published reliability metrics, you're taking their word for it. Maybe they're excellent. Maybe they're not. You won't know until you're in production and something breaks at 2 AM on a Friday.

We're transparent about this number because it's the metric that actually matters for your product. Not uptime pages (everyone has those), not "99.9% reliability" marketing copy - actual post success rates.

## Verbose Errors for Real Debugging

When that 2% fails, error quality determines whether you debug for minutes or hours.

Here's what our [error responses](/api-reference/errors) actually look like:

```json
{
  "errorsVerbose": {
    "INSTAGRAM": {
      "code": "META:190",
      "userFacingMessage": "Your Instagram token expired. Please reconnect.",
      "errorMessage": "OAuthException: Validate permission failed.",
      "isTransient": false
    },
    "TIKTOK": null
  }
}
```

Every failed platform gets its own entry in `errorsVerbose`. Each entry includes:

| Field | What it gives you |
| :--- | :--- |
| `code` | Stable error code for programmatic handling (e.g., `META:190`, `HTTP:429`, `TT:spam_risk_too_many_posts`) |
| `userFacingMessage` | Safe to show your users. No stack traces leaking. |
| `errorMessage` | Raw developer context - the upstream platform error |
| `isTransient` | `true` = retry later. `false` = fix the input or reconnect the account |

Platform prefixes tell you instantly where the problem is: `META` (Instagram, Facebook, Threads), `TT` (TikTok), `LI` (LinkedIn), `YT` (YouTube), `HTTP` (generic API errors).

Your error handling code can be smart because it has the information it needs:

```typescript
if (error.errorsVerbose?.INSTAGRAM) {
  const igError = error.errorsVerbose.INSTAGRAM;

  if (igError.isTransient) {
    // Rate limit or temporary issue - retry with backoff
    await scheduleRetry(postId);
  } else if (igError.code.startsWith('META:190')) {
    // Token expired - prompt user to reconnect
    await notifyUser('Your Instagram needs reconnecting');
  } else {
    // Content rejected or permanent failure - log and move on
    await markPostFailed(postId, igError.userFacingMessage);
  }
}
```

This is the difference between "Error: post failed" and knowing exactly what went wrong, on which platform, and whether retrying is pointless. Your on-call rotation will thank you.

## Analytics Through One API

At paid tiers, [analytics](/api-reference/analytics) come included. Pull engagement metrics - likes, comments, shares, views, impressions - through the same API you use for posting.

We normalize data across platforms so you're not reconciling Instagram's definition of "reach" with LinkedIn's version of "impressions" from five different APIs. One call, consistent data format, all platforms.

```typescript
// Same API, same format, all platforms
const analytics = await fetch(
  'https://api.bundle.social/api/v1/analytics/social-account?teamId=team_123&platformType=INSTAGRAM',
  { headers: { 'x-api-key': process.env.BUNDLE_API_KEY } }
).then(r => r.json());

// analytics.items[] - normalized snapshots: impressions, views,
// likes, comments, saves - consistent schema across platforms
const latest = analytics.items.at(-1);
```

<Note>
**40-day retention.** We keep analytics data for 40 days. If you need longer history, fetch and store it on your end. Build a daily cron, pipe it to your database. We told you. Right here. In this doc.
</Note>

For products that don't need analytics yet - no extra cost. For products that eventually need reporting dashboards, you won't have to bolt on another integration layer.

## Flat Pricing, No Surprises

Some APIs charge per post, per profile, or per API call. This creates unpredictable costs, especially for products with variable usage. A good month becomes a billing problem.

bundle.social uses flat pricing:

- **Pro:** $100/month - 1,000 posts, unlimited social sets
- **Business:** $400/month - 100,000 posts

No watching meters. No throttling your own features to control billing. No surprise invoices after a good month. No building [rate limiters](/api-reference/rate-limits) to protect your budget instead of building features for your users.

You pick your tier, you know your costs. Period.

## No Social Account Limits. Seriously.

Most social media APIs charge per connected account or cap how many you can connect at each tier. 10 accounts on the starter plan. 50 on pro. "Contact sales" for more.

We don't do that.

Connect 10 accounts. Connect 100. Connect 100,000. We don't care. There's no per-account fee, no hidden tier gate, no "you've reached your account limit" error at the worst possible moment. Your pricing is based on posts, not profiles.

This matters if you're building a product where your users connect their own accounts. An agency tool with 200 clients, each with 5 platforms? That's 1,000 connected accounts. On per-account pricing, that's a line item that grows every time you land a new client. With us, it's the same price it was when you had 10.

Scale your user base without doing mental math on whether each new customer is still profitable after API costs.

## Support That Actually Responds (We Mean It)

I'm not going to claim our support is "world-class" because every company says that. Instead, here's how we compare to the alternatives you're probably evaluating:

| | bundle.social | Ayrshare | Upload-Post |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Avg. chat response** | ~10 minutes | Available* | No live chat - email only |
| **Avg. email response** | Same day (usually hours)* | 1-3 business days* | 1-5 business days* |
| **Weekend availability** | Yes - we check in evenings & weekends | No | No |
| **Who responds** | Engineer with codebase context | Support team / docs links | Support team / docs links |
| **Custom debugging help** | Yes - we'll look at your specific request logs | Limited | Limited |

*\*Full transparency: we don't actually know Ayrshare's or Upload-Post's real response times. We haven't sat there with a stopwatch timing their support tickets. These are vibes-based estimates from what developers have told us. We're obviously biased - this is our blog, we're comparing ourselves to competitors, and we want to look good. Take the exact numbers with a grain of salt. But the 10-minute chat response on our side? That one we can back up. Try us.*

Our average chat response time is around **10 minutes** on business days. Not a bot. Not a "we've received your message" autoresponder. A human who knows the codebase and can actually help you debug.

And here's the part that matters when you're choosing an API your product depends on: **we respond on evenings and weekends too.** We know part-time founders and indie developers build in every free moment they have - 11 PM on a Saturday, Sunday morning before the kids wake up, holiday evenings. If you're grinding, we're available.

We've had developers switch to us specifically because they couldn't get a response from their previous provider when something broke in production. An expired token on a Friday afternoon becomes a weekend-long outage if support doesn't respond until Monday. With us, it's a 10-minute fix.

With a smaller team, there's zero bureaucracy between your question and someone who knows the codebase. No ticket routing. No "I'll escalate this to the engineering team." The person on chat IS the engineering team.

<Tip>
**Pro tip:** Before committing to any API, try reaching out with a technical question on a Friday evening. See how fast and helpful the response is. That tells you more about the partnership than any sales page or uptime dashboard.

## Features on Request

If you need a feature we don't have, ask. If it makes sense for the platform and we can build it reasonably, it typically ships in weeks, not quarters.

We've added integrations, API endpoints, and [webhook](/api-reference/webhooks) events based on direct customer requests. Not every request is possible, but we're responsive to reasonable ones. There's no roadmap committee or quarterly planning cycle blocking the path from "customer needs X" to "X is in production."

## 14+ Platforms

Current platform support:

**Major platforms:** [Instagram](/api-reference/platforms/instagram), [Facebook](/api-reference/platforms/facebook), [LinkedIn](/api-reference/platforms/linkedin), [Twitter/X](/api-reference/platforms/twitter), [TikTok](/api-reference/platforms/tiktok), [YouTube](/api-reference/platforms/youtube), [Pinterest](/api-reference/platforms/pinterest)

**Community platforms:** [Discord](/api-reference/platforms/discord), [Slack](/api-reference/platforms/slack), [Reddit](/api-reference/platforms/reddit)

**Emerging networks:** [Mastodon](/api-reference/platforms/mastodon), [Bluesky](/api-reference/platforms/bluesky), [Threads](/api-reference/platforms/threads)

**Business:** [Google Business Profile](/api-reference/platforms/google-business)

If you're evaluating any API, check their current platform list against your actual requirements. "Coming soon" doesn't help if you need it now.

## The Web App Bonus

Some APIs are API-only by design. bundle.social has a full [web app](https://bundle.social/dashboard) alongside the API.

For pure developer integrations, this might not matter. But for products where some users want a visual interface - agencies giving clients approval access, internal teams who prefer drag-and-drop scheduling, stakeholders who want to see what's queued - having a web app means you don't have to build one.

Everything in the web app is also in the API. It's not either/or. The web app is just there if you need it.

## When to Switch

**Switch if:**
- You need proven reliability metrics, not promises
- You've hit vague errors that cost you debugging hours
- Support responses are slow or unhelpful
- You need platforms that aren't supported yet
- You need [analytics](/api-reference/analytics) without bolting on another integration
- Pricing unpredictability is creating budget anxiety

**Don't switch if:**
- Everything is working fine and you're happy

We're confident in how we compare on these factors. But confidence isn't proof. Check the [docs](/api-reference/introduction), try the free tier (10 posts/month - enough to validate a real integration) or we can hook you up with free dev month, and see if the claims hold up in practice.
