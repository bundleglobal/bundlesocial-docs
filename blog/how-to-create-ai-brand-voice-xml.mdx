## TL;DR

- Generic AI prompts = generic AI content. Words like "delve", "tapestry", "landscape" everywhere.
- XML is the best format for system prompts. LLMs parse tags strictly, so your rules actually get followed.
- One `brand_voice.xml` file can control tone, personality, platform rules, engagement style, banned words, and more across all your automations.
- The template below has 15+ configurable sections. Use all of it or just the parts you need.
- Copy-paste, fill in your details, done.

You know the problem. You ask ChatGPT to write a LinkedIn post and it comes back with "In the rapidly evolving landscape of..." and you want to throw your laptop out the window.

It's technically correct. It's also completely soulless. It uses words nobody uses in real life. It uses emojis like a middle schooler in 2012.

The fix isn't writing longer prompts. The fix is **structured data**. Specifically, XML.

## Why XML?

LLMs are trained on code. They understand structure. When you write a paragraph of text describing your tone, the model has to guess which parts are rules and which parts are just vibes.

When you use XML tags like `<tone>`, `<banned_words>`, and `<formatting>`, you're speaking the model's native language. You're creating hard boundaries that the model is way less likely to ignore.

Paragraphs = suggestions. XML tags = rules. That's basically it.

## The Brand Voice XML Template

This is the full, production-ready XML we use at bundle.social (and that our clients use) to generate content and fix rough drafts. It's modular. You don't have to fill out every section. Skip what doesn't apply, add more when you need it.

Copy this, save it as `brand_voice.xml`, fill in your details.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

  <meta>
    <company_name>Acme Corp</company_name>

  PERSONALITY & TONE SETTINGS
  ============================================
  Think of these as sliders. Each trait is on a scale.
  The AI will use these to calibrate how it writes.

    <!-- Scale: 0 (cold, data-only) to 10 (therapist-level warmth) -->
    <empathy>6</empathy>
    <!-- Scale: 0 (passive, suggestive) to 10 (commanding, authoritative) -->
    <assertiveness>7</assertiveness>
    <!-- Scale: 0 (reserved, modest) to 10 (bold, provocative) -->
    <boldness>6</boldness>
    <!-- Scale: 0 (no opinions) to 10 (hot takes only) -->
    <opinionated>7</opinionated>
    <!-- Scale: 0 (never self-reference) to 10 (everything is a personal story) -->
    <personal_anecdotes>5</personal_anecdotes>
    <!-- Scale: 0 (100% original) to 10 (meme-heavy, pop culture heavy) -->

## What each section does

The template is modular. Skip what you don't need. Here's the breakdown.

### `<personality>` - The sliders

The most useful section, tbh. Think of it as a mixing board for your brand's character. Each trait goes 0 to 10:

| Setting | Low (0) | High (10) |
|---|---|---|
| `humor_level` | Dead serious, no jokes | Stand-up comedian energy |
| `formality` | Texting a friend | Writing a legal brief |
| `empathy` | Cold, data-only | Therapist-level warmth |
| `assertiveness` | Passive, suggestive | Commanding, authoritative |
| `boldness` | Reserved, modest | Provocative hot takes |
| `opinionated` | Neutral on everything | Strong opinions on everything |
| `personal_anecdotes` | Never self-reference | Every post is a personal story |
| `pop_culture_references` | Zero references | Meme-heavy |

These numbers give the AI way more to work with than "be professional but friendly." `formality: 5` with `humor_level: 4` is specific. The AI can actually calibrate off that.

### `<emotional_tone>` - Mood control

Enable or disable specific emotional registers. Want your brand to show vulnerability when you mess up? Turn it on. Want to avoid fake urgency? Disable it. Each emotion has its own rules so the AI knows exactly how far to go.

### `<audience_segments>` - Different people, different tone

A LinkedIn post for CTOs should read differently than a tutorial for junior devs. Define your segments with expected knowledge level and tone adjustments. When you prompt the AI, just tell it which segment you're targeting.

### `<platforms>` - Platform-specific overrides

This is where it gets really useful. Each platform has different character limits, norms, and expectations. The `<platforms>` section lets you override global settings per platform:

- **LinkedIn:** Professional but human, scroll-stopping hooks, hashtags at the end only.
- **Twitter/X:** Punchier, shorter, hotter takes allowed.
- **Instagram:** Visual-friendly language, emoji bullets okay, hashtags in first comment.
- **TikTok:** Ultra casual, hook-driven scripts, under 60 seconds.
- **YouTube:** Conversational, description optimization, thumbnail text rules.
- **Blog:** Long-form, SEO-optimized, with TL;DR and table of contents.

### `<content_pillars>` - What to talk about (and what not to)

Define your content categories with weights. This keeps the AI (and you) from posting about the same thing every single day. Also has an `<off_limits>` section for topics that are just not worth the risk.

### `<storytelling>` - Narrative frameworks

Instead of letting the AI pick some random structure, you tell it which frameworks to use and when. Problem-solution for product posts. Hot-take format for thought leadership. Tutorial format for guides. The AI picks the right one based on context.

### `<engagement>` - How to handle replies and drama

Most people forget this part. Your brand voice isn't just posts. It's comments, replies, and how you handle criticism. This section covers:

- How to reply to comments
- How to handle criticism (acknowledge, don't get defensive)
- How to mention competitors (don't bash, focus on what makes you different)
- How to handle controversy (stick to facts)

### `<hashtags>` - Strategy per platform

30 hashtags on Instagram is normal. 30 hashtags on Twitter makes you look unhinged. Define your strategy per platform and ban the cringe ones (`#hustle`, `#grindset`, go away).

### `<llm_readability>` - Anti-AI detection

This section makes the biggest difference in output quality. It's rules specifically designed to make AI output sound human:

- Vary sentence length
- Use contractions
- Avoid classic AI transition words ("Moreover", "Furthermore")
- Mix in self-corrections and incomplete thoughts
- Never start two paragraphs with the same word

### `<banned_phrases>` - Kill the cliches

Banned words are good. Banned phrases are better. "In today's fast-paced world" is dead. "I'm thrilled to announce" is dead. Add every AI cliche you encounter to this list. It only gets more useful over time.

### `<inclusive_language>` - Don't be that brand

Gender-neutral by default. No ableist language. No US-centric assumptions. Use `allowlist/denylist` instead of `whitelist/blacklist`. These aren't just nice-to-haves, they prevent embarrassing mistakes at scale.

### `<posting_cadence>` - Content calendar rules

Optional, but useful for batch-generating content. Tell the AI how often to post per platform. Include the rule about not posting the same topic on two platforms on the same day (it happens more than you'd think).

## How to use this XML

### Option 1: ChatGPT / Claude (Projects)

Upload this `brand_voice.xml` file to your project knowledge in Claude or ChatGPT.

Then your prompt can be as simple as:
> "Write a LinkedIn post about our new feature based on the guidelines in brand_voice.xml. Target the developers segment."

The model reads the file and applies every rule. You can also reference specific sections:
> "Write a Twitter thread following the hot-take framework from the storytelling section."

### Option 2: n8n (Automated Workflows)

If you're building the [social media automation workflow](/blog/automate-social-media-n8n) we covered earlier, this is a massive upgrade.

1. Upload your XML file to a URL (GitHub Gist, your website, wherever) or store it in a Google Doc.
2. In n8n, use an **HTTP Request** node (or Google Drive node) to fetch the file content.
3. Pass the content into the **System Message** of your AI Agent node.

**System Prompt Example:**
```text
You are a social media manager for Acme Corp.
Strictly follow the brand guidelines provided in the XML context below.
Focus especially on the <banned_words>, <banned_phrases>, and <personality> sections.
Today you are writing for the "linkedin" platform targeting the "developers" audience segment.

<xml_context>
{{ $json.xml_content }}
</xml_context>
```

### Option 3: Selective loading (for the optimization nerds)

If your XML file gets big, you don't have to load the whole thing every time. Parse out only the sections you need:

- **LinkedIn post:** load `<personality>`, `<voice>`, `<platforms id="linkedin">`, `<banned_words>`, `<banned_phrases>`, and `<examples>`.
- **Comment reply:** load `<engagement>`, `<voice>`, and `<personality>`.
- **Blog post:** load everything.

This keeps your token count down and your costs low.

## Why this beats "Custom Instructions"

Custom instructions are fine, but they're limited in length and annoying to version control. An XML file is a living document.

- **Version control.** Commit it to Git. Track how your brand voice evolves.
- **Scalability.** Add new sections (`<product_specs>`, `<seasonal_campaigns>`, whatever) without breaking the existing structure.
- **Portability.** Same file works across ChatGPT, Claude, n8n, Make, and your custom code.
- **Modularity.** Load only the sections you need per use case. Writing a tweet? You don't need the blog SEO rules.
- **Collaboration.** Your whole team contributes to one file. Marketing adds examples, engineering adds technical terms, leadership adds off-limits topics.

## Summary

Stop letting AI define your voice. Define it yourself, in code.

The more specific your XML is, the less "AI-flavored" your output gets. Personality sliders, platform-specific rules, banned phrases, engagement guidelines, storytelling frameworks. Each section gives the model one more constraint. And constraints are what make good writing.

Treat your brand voice as a dataset, not a "vibe." You'll never have to read the word "tapestry" in your own posts again.
