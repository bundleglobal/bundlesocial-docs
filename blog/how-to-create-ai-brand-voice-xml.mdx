## TL;DR / Key Takeaways

- Generic AI prompts produce generic "AI-sounding" content (words like "delve", "tapestry", "landscape").
- XML is the best format for System Prompts because LLMs parse tags strictly.
- A single "Brand Voice XML" file can control tone, formatting, and banned words across all your automations.
- We provide a free, copy-paste XML template you can adapt today.

If I read one more LinkedIn post that starts with "In the rapidly evolving landscape of..." I'm going to scream.

We all know the problem. You ask ChatGPT or Claude to write a social media post, and it gives you something that is technically correct but completely soulless. It uses words nobody uses in real life. It uses emojis like a 14-year-old in 2012.

The solution isn't "better prompt engineering" in the sense of writing longer paragraphs of text. The solution is **structured data**. Specifically, XML.

## Why XML?

Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on code. They understand structure. When you write a paragraph of text describing your tone, the model has to "guess" which parts are rules and which parts are just suggestions.

When you use XML tags like `<tone>`, `<banned_words>`, and `<formatting>`, you are speaking the model's native language. You are creating strict boundaries that the model is much less likely to ignore.

## The "Brand Voice XML" Template

Here is a stripped-down, anonymized version of the actual XML file we use at bundle.social to generate content. Copy this, save it as `brand_voice.xml`, and fill in your details.

## How to use this XML

### Option 1: In ChatGPT / Claude (Projects)
If you use the "Projects" feature in Claude or ChatGPT, simply upload this `brand_voice.xml` file to your project knowledge.

Then, your prompt can be as simple as:
> "Write a LinkedIn post about our new feature based on the guidelines in brand_voice.xml"

The model will read the file and apply every rule strictly.

### Option 2: In n8n (Automated Workflows)
If you are building the [social media automation workflow](/blog/automate-social-media-n8n) we discussed previously, this is a game changer.

1.  Upload your XML file to a URL (e.g., your website or a GitHub Gist) or store it in a Google Doc.
2.  In n8n, use an **HTTP Request** node (or Google Drive node) to fetch the file content.
3.  Pass the content into the **System Message** of your AI Agent node.

**System Prompt Example:**
```text
You are a social media manager for Acme Corp.
Strictly follow the brand guidelines provided in the XML context below.
Focus especially on the <banned_words> list.

<xml_context>
{{ $json.xml_content }}
</xml_context>
```

## Why this works better than "Custom Instructions"

Custom instructions are great, but they are limited in length and hard to version control. An XML file is a living document.

*   **Version Control:** You can commit it to Git.
*   **Scalability:** You can add new sections (e.g., `<product_specs>`) without breaking the existing structure.
*   **Portability:** You can use the same file across ChatGPT, n8n, Make, and your custom code.

## Summary

Stop letting AI define your voice. Define it yourself in code.

By treating your brand voice as a dataset rather than a "vibe," you regain control over your content quality. And you'll never have to read the word "tapestry" in your own posts again.
