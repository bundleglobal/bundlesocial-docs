Uploading a 500MB video to [YouTube](/api-reference/platforms/youtube) takes time. Processing it takes even longer.
If your API client waits for a response, it will timeout.

## The Shower Principle

Good architecture is like a shower thought: It happens in the background while you do something else.

1.  **Fire and Forget:** You send us the video. We say "Received". You hang up.
2.  **Background Worker:** We transcode, upload, and verify the video with YouTube.
3.  **Webhook:** We call you back: "It's done."

## Designing for Async

*   **UI:** Don't show a spinner. Show a "Processing" state and let the user leave the page.
*   **Database:** Store a `status` field (`pending`, `processing`, `published`).
*   **Webhooks:** Always listen for `post.failed`. Background jobs fail silently if you don't listen.
