title: "Scraping vs. Official APIs: The Legal Battlefield"
description: Why relying on undocumented endpoints and scraping is a ticking time bomb for your startup.

In the early days of social media tools, everyone scraped. It was the wild west. You reversed-engineered the private API, used headless browsers, and pretended to be an iPhone.

**Those days are over.**

## The Platform Crackdown

Platforms like X ([Twitter](/api-reference/platforms/twitter)), [Reddit](/api-reference/platforms/reddit), and [LinkedIn](/api-reference/platforms/linkedin) have declared war on unauthorized data access.
*   **Legal Action:** Companies are being sued into oblivion.
*   **IP Bans:** Entire server blocks are blacklisted.
*   **Account Suspensions:** Your users get banned for using your tool.

## The Case for Official APIs

Yes, official APIs have limits. Yes, they cost money (sometimes). But they offer one thing scraping doesn't: **Sustainability.**

1.  **Stability:** An official endpoint doesn't change its HTML structure every Tuesday.
2.  **Scale:** You can legally request quota increases. You can't ask for "more scraping throughput."
3.  **Trust:** Your customers (especially Enterprise) demand compliance. They won't use a tool that violates ToS.

## Conclusion

If you are building a serious business, build it on bedrock, not quicksand. Use official APIs (or unified layers like `bundle.social`) and sleep at night.
