## TL;DR

- **The Switch Triggers:** Usage-based pricing surprises, missing platforms, slow feature requests, or reliability concerns.
- **bundle.social Difference:** Flat pricing (no post counting), 2% error rate, verbose error responses, analytics included, features built on request, and support that actually responds.
- **The Honest Take:** Ayrshare is solid. But if their model doesn't fit, here's what we do differently.

## Why Developers Look for Ayrshare Alternatives

Ayrshare built a good product. They were early, their docs are decent, and for many use cases, they work fine. So when developers start searching for alternatives, it's usually because something specific isn't working for them.

The most common friction points we hear:
- Pricing that scales unpredictably with usage
- Platforms that aren't supported and won't be anytime soon
- Feature requests that disappear into a void
- Reliability issues that are hard to debug without responsive support

If Ayrshare is working for you, there's no reason to switch. But if you're hitting these walls, here's what we do differently.

## Flat Pricing vs. Usage Anxiety

Ayrshare prices by posts and profiles. This works fine at predictable volumes, but it creates anxiety for products with variable usage. A viral moment that 10x your posting volume also 10x your API bill. You find yourself adding code to throttle your own features because you're watching the meter.

bundle.social uses flat pricing. You pick a tier based on your needs, and that's what you pay. No counting posts. No surprise invoices. No building [rate limiters](/api-reference/rate-limits) to protect your budget instead of building features for your users.

The Pro tier is $100/month for 1,000 posts and unlimited social sets. The Business tier is $400/month for 100,000 posts. If you know roughly where you land, you know your costs. Period.

For products still figuring out their usage patterns, this removes a variable from the equation. You can focus on growth without checking the billing dashboard every morning.

## The 2% Error Rate

Here's a number we track obsessively: our error rate in production sits around 2%.

That means 98% of scheduled posts publish successfully, on time, to the right platform. The 2% that fail are almost always platform-side issues - expired tokens (user revoked access), content policy rejections, or temporary platform outages. Things we can't control, but we surface clearly so you can handle them.

We track this because reliability is the whole point of using a unified API. If you're spending time debugging failed posts and retrying uploads, you're not saving time versus integrating directly with platforms. The abstraction only helps if it actually works.

## Verbose Errors That Actually Help

When something does fail, you need to know why. Not "Error 500" or "Post failed" - actual information you can act on.

Our [error responses](/api-reference/errors) include:
- Specific error codes
- Human-readable messages explaining what went wrong
- Context about whether the failure is retryable

If a token expired, we tell you which account and why. If content was rejected, we pass through the platform's rejection reason. If you hit a rate limit, we tell you when you can retry.

This matters because debugging API issues is time-consuming. Vague errors mean hours of guesswork. Verbose errors mean you fix the problem and move on. Your error handling code can make intelligent decisions - retry transient failures, alert users about expired connections, skip content policy violations - instead of treating every failure the same.

## Analytics Included

At paid tiers, analytics are part of the package. Pull engagement data - likes, comments, shares, views - through the same API you use for posting. One integration, not two.

This means you're not stitching together our posting API with separate calls to Instagram's Graph API and LinkedIn's Analytics API and Twitter's engagement endpoints. We normalize the data across platforms so "engagement" means the same thing regardless of source.

For products building dashboards or reporting features, this saves significant integration time. For products that just need posting, ignore it - but it's there when you need it.

## Features on Request

Here's something that surprises developers who've worked with larger API providers: when you request a feature, we actually build it.

Not every request, and not immediately. But if you need something that makes sense for the platform and doesn't require rewriting our core architecture, it usually ships within weeks, not quarters. We've added platform integrations, API endpoints, and [webhook](/api-reference/webhooks) events based on direct customer requests.

This happens because we're still small enough to be responsive. There's no product committee meeting to schedule, no quarterly roadmap that can't be adjusted, no bureaucracy between "customer needs X" and "X is in production."

## Support That Responds

I'm not going to claim our support is "world-class" or "exceptional" because every company says that. Here's what I can say concretely:

When you email or message us, a human responds. Usually within hours on business days. That human has context on the codebase and can actually help troubleshoot, not just link you to docs you've already read.

If you're debugging an integration issue at 2 PM on a Tuesday, you're not waiting until next week for a response. If you're blocked by something that looks like a bug on our end, we prioritize investigating it.

## Platform Coverage

Quick comparison on supported platforms:

**Ayrshare covers:** Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, TikTok, YouTube, Pinterest, Telegram, Google Business Profile.

**bundle.social covers those plus:** [Discord](/api-reference/platforms/discord), [Slack](/api-reference/platforms/slack), [Reddit](/api-reference/platforms/reddit), [Mastodon](/api-reference/platforms/mastodon), [Bluesky](/api-reference/platforms/bluesky), and [Threads](/api-reference/platforms/threads).

If you need community platforms or emerging decentralized networks, Ayrshare can't help you today. If you're building something focused purely on the traditional major platforms, both work.

## The Web App Bonus

Ayrshare is API-only by design. bundle.social has a full web app alongside the API.

For pure developer integrations, this might not matter. But for products where some users want a visual interface - agencies giving clients approval access, internal teams who prefer drag-and-drop scheduling, stakeholders who want to see what's queued - having a web app means you don't have to build one.

Everything in the web app is also in the API. It's not either/or. The web app is just there if you need it.

## When to Switch

**Switch if:**
- Ayrshare's pricing model creates budget anxiety for your use case
- You need platforms they don't support
- You've had support experiences that left you waiting
- You've requested features that went nowhere
- Reliability has been inconsistent
- You're wasting time on vague error messages

**Don't switch if:**
- Everything is working fine, and you are happy with the support

But if you're actively evaluating, check the [docs](/api-reference/introduction), try the free tier, and see if the fit is better. The 10 free posts per month give you enough to test a real integration without commitment (or write to us on chat for free month).
