Metrics like "Likes" are vanity. "Comments" are sanity.
But reading 1,000 comments manually is impossible.

## The Data Pipeline

Here is how you build a sentiment analysis engine using `bundle.social`:

1.  **Ingest:** Use the API to fetch comments from all connected accounts ([Instagram](/api-reference/platforms/instagram), [LinkedIn](/api-reference/platforms/linkedin), [YouTube](/api-reference/platforms/youtube)).
2.  **Normalize:** We give you a standard JSON format, so you don't need to parse 3 different structures.
3.  **Analyze:** Pass the comment text to a lightweight NLP model (or OpenAI).
4.  **Tag:** Label them: `Support`, `Bug Report`, `Sales Lead`.

## Why Build This?

Your customers (agencies, brands) will pay a premium for "Qualitative Analytics." Telling them "You got 50 likes" is boring. Telling them "People hate the new logo color" is valuable.
