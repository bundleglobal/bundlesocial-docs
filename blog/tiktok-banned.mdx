Every few months, headlines scream that [TikTok](/api-reference/platforms/tiktok) is getting banned. Whether it's the US, EU, or India (where it's already gone), the threat is real.

## The Developer's Risk

If you build your entire business or content strategy on a single platform's API, you have a **single point of failure**.

*   **Scenario A:** You built a custom integration for TikTok. TikTok gets banned. Your code is useless. You panic.
*   **Scenario B:** You use a unified API like **bundle.social**. TikTok gets banned. You switch your `socialAccountTypes` array to include `['YOUTUBE', 'INSTAGRAM']` (Shorts and Reels). Your code keeps working. You sleep well.

## Diversification via API

The only way to survive platform volatility is to be platform-agnostic.

1.  **Write Once, Post Everywhere:** Don't tailor your backend to TikTok's specific quirky API. Use a normalized interface.
2.  **Archive Your Data:** Use our **Import API** to back up your content and analytics. If a platform disappears, your data shouldn't go with it.

## Conclusion

We don't know if TikTok will be banned. But we know that relying on one platform is bad engineering. Abstract the risk away.
