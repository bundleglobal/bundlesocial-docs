If you are building a social media dashboard, you will eventually hit the **N+1 problem**.

You fetch a team. Then you loop through their accounts. Then you loop through their posts. Then you loop through the analytics for each post.

```python
# The Bad Way
for post in posts:
    analyze(post) # Slow. Painful. API limits will eat you.
```

## Vectorization & Batching

When dealing with data-heavy APIs like bundle.social (or underlying platforms), you need to think in batches.

1.  **Batch Requests:** Don't ask for one post's analytics. Ask for 50.
2.  **Vectorized Processing:** If you are calculating engagement rates in Python (pandas) or JS, process the whole array at once.

## Why it matters for Social APIs

Social data is "bursty". A user connects an account and wants to see 3 years of history **now**. If you loop, your UI hangs. If you batch and vectorize, you look like a wizard.
