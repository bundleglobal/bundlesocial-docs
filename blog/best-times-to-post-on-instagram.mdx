title: 'Algorithmic Scheduling: Why "Best Times to Post" are a myth'
description: Stop looking for generic "best times" charts. Use API data to find when YOUR audience is actually online.

Every year, a dozen marketing blogs publish the same chart: "Post on Tuesdays at 10 AM."

**This is nonsense.**

If you are building a social media tool, you shouldn't hardcode these magic numbers. You should use data.

## The "Best Time" is Dynamic

[Instagram](/api-reference/platforms/instagram)'s algorithm prioritizes engagement. If your audience is night-shift nurses, posting at 10 AM (when they are asleep) is suicide.

As a developer, you have access to the truth: **The Graph API.**

## How to build "Smart Scheduling"

Instead of guessing, use the `bundle.social` API (or raw Instagram API) to fetch audience insights.

1.  **Fetch Audience Metrics:** Query the `insights` endpoint for `audience_activity`.
2.  **Analyze the Heatmap:** You will get a breakdown of when followers are online (e.g., `18:00`, `19:00`, `20:00`).
3.  **Automate:** Build a scheduler that takes a post and automatically slots it into the next high-traffic window.

## Conclusion

Static advice is for amateurs. Smart tools use APIs to adapt to reality. Don't build a scheduler that posts at 10 AM because a blog post said so. Build one that posts when the users are there.
