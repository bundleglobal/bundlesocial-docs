We love technology. But we hate complexity.

In the world of social media automation, developers often fall into the trap of over-engineering.
*   "We need a Kafka cluster for message queuing." (You post 10 times a day).
*   "We need a Kubernetes mesh." (You have one Node.js server).

## The Boring Stack

The most successful social tools we see use boring technology.
*   **Postgres:** For storing post metadata.
*   **Redis:** For simple job queues.
*   **bundle.social:** For handling the API chaos.

## Focus on the Product

Your user doesn't care if you use microservices. They care if the [Instagram](/api-reference/platforms/instagram) Reel posts on time.
Spend your complexity tokens on the user experience, not the infrastructure.
