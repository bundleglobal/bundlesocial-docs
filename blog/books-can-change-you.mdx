In the API business, documentation isn't "support." Documentation is the **User Interface**.

## The "RTFM" Fallacy

You can't tell a developer to "Read The Manual" if the manual is a PDF from 2019.
We treat our docs (`docs.bundle.social`) with the same engineering rigor as our API.

1.  **Searchable:** If you can't CMD+K to find "[TikTok](/api-reference/platforms/tiktok) Limits", we failed.
2.  **Copy-Pasteable:** Every code snippet must be runnable.
3.  **Honest:** If an endpoint is flaky, we write a `<Warning>` box. We don't hide bugs in the footnotes.

## Continuous Integration for Docs

We update our docs daily. New endpoint? New docs. Platform quirk discovered? New docs.
Because in the end, you aren't buying an API key. You're buying the knowledge of how to use it.
